        These days, encryption is becoming more and more important to understand, politically and
personally. However, when it gets discussed in an open forum, it&rsquo;s usually discussed so abstractly
that the layperson doesn&rsquo;t really understand the specifics of what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here
for. I&rsquo;m going to talk about encryption in a way that anyone can understand, and explain how it
works and why.
What is Encryption? #From Wikipedia: &ldquo;encryption is the process of
encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it&rdquo;.
Essentially, this means we want our data to be a secret from anyone who tries to look at it. The
internet, and almost everything on it, needs encryption to function. The process of turning
encrypted information back into useful information is called &ldquo;decryption&rdquo;. Banks need to protect
information to protect identity theft. Companies need it to protect intellectual property. In fact,
everything that has a login screen should have encryption (some sites haven&rsquo;t caught up yet) to
prevent bad actors from intercepting the message and stealing passwords.

        <p>These days, encryption is becoming more and more important to understand, politically and
personally. However, when it gets discussed in an open forum, it&rsquo;s usually discussed so abstractly
that the layperson doesn&rsquo;t really understand the specifics of what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here
for. I&rsquo;m going to talk about encryption in a way that anyone can understand, and explain how it
works and why.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-encryption" class="relative group">What is Encryption? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#what-is-encryption" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;<em>encryption is the process of
encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it</em>&rdquo;.
Essentially, this means we want our data to be a secret from anyone who tries to look at it. The
internet, and almost everything on it, <em>needs</em> encryption to function. The process of turning
encrypted information back into useful information is called &ldquo;decryption&rdquo;. Banks need to protect
information to protect identity theft. Companies need it to protect intellectual property. In fact,
<em>everything that has a login screen</em> should have encryption (some sites haven&rsquo;t caught up yet) to
prevent bad actors from intercepting the message and stealing passwords.</p>
<p>As an example, one of the oldest, simplest, and least secure forms of encryption is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Caesar Cipher</a>. The idea is that you take a message
and shift all the letters. So for a Caesar Cipher of shift 1, A becomes B, B becomes C, Z becomes A,
and so on. The idea is that someone who sees the message can&rsquo;t read it without knowing the shift.</p>
<p>Important to understanding encryption is the idea of <em>keys</em>. A key is essentially a secret code that
tells you how the cipher works. In a Caesar Cipher, the <em>key</em> is the shift. So if we have a shift
of 5, we know that to encrypt it we have to shift the letters forward 5, and to decrypt it we have
to shift them backward 5. A key can be used to lock or unlock your data as needed.</p>
<h1 id="symmetric-and-asymmetric" class="relative group">Symmetric and Asymmetric <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#symmetric-and-asymmetric" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>There are two kinds of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. These words refer to how the keys work.
In symmetric encryption, you use the same key for encryption and decryption. It&rsquo;s the same on both
sides, so it&rsquo;s <em>symmetric</em>. This means that in asymmetric encryption, you need a different key for
encrypting and decrypting.</p>
<p>Both are important, for different reasons. The short of it is that symmetric keys are usually used
for storing data, while asymmetric keys are typically used for communication. To understand why, we
need to look a bit closer at how they actually work.</p>
<h1 id="walkthrough" class="relative group">Walkthrough <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#walkthrough" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>I&rsquo;m going to be walking through an example using <a href="https://www.openssl.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenSSL</a>, a widely-used,
free, and libre/open-source (meaning that the code behind it is in the public domain) encryption
tool. My examples will be designed to work in the macOS Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal),
the Linux terminal, and the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on a mac and want to follow along, you&rsquo;ll need to do two things. First, if you haven&rsquo;t
installed <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">homebrew</a>, do so now. Next, run <code>brew install openssl</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on Windows, you&rsquo;ll need to download and install
<a href="https://slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL-1_1_0f.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenSSL for Windows</a>. Then, press the
&ldquo;Windows&rdquo; key on your keyboard, type &ldquo;cmd&rdquo; and hit enter - it should open the command prompt.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-crash-course" class="relative group">Terminal Crash Course <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#terminal-crash-course" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The terminal, or command prompt on Windows, is one of the oldest ways of using a computer
interactively. The idea is pretty simple - type a command, hit enter, and it executes a program and
writes the output on the screen below your command. Commands are generally made of two parts - the
command name and the arguments. The command name tells it what program to run like how when you open
an application, you need to tell it what application to run. Arguments give it information on <em>how</em>
it should run. For example, if you open Notepad, you might send it a file, and it will open that
file instead of making a new document.</p>
<p>Arguments on the command line are often more complex than that example though. Commands like these
are generally made to be able to run without human interaction, so arguments replace the user
interface. There are generally three types of arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flags: These are a simple way to toggle something on/off. for example, in Windows installers,
running them with <code>/q</code> will run them in quiet mode, where they don&rsquo;t have any prompts. They

<li>Keyword Arguments: These are arguments whose significance is determined by a flag-like preceding
command. The difference between a keyword argument and a flag can be hard to tell -
syntactically they&rsquo;re very similar. It depends on how the developer implemented that argument -
there is no standard differentiator.</li>
<li>Positional Arguments: These are arguments that aren&rsquo;t part of a keyword argument, and whose
meaning is determined by their order. For example, in the UNIX copy command, the first argument
is the file to copy, and the second is where to put it. For example, <code>cp myfile.txt ~/Documents</code>
will copy the file &ldquo;myfile.txt&rdquo; to my Documents folder.</li>

<li><code>-aes-256-cbc</code> - this flag specifies the encryption algorithm we&rsquo;re going to use. AES-256 is an industry

works, and why it&rsquo;s secure. On a side note, the exact algorithm and technology that AES uses is
publicly available in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RFC 3565</a> (this has very advanced
computer engineering and mathematics - don&rsquo;t expect to understand it, just take away that the exact
implementation details are in the public domain).</p>

<li>Encrypting laptops and phones so if they get stolen or accessed by a bad actor, data can&rsquo;t

<li>WiFi passwords - used to encrypt the airwaves so any shmuck with an antenna can&rsquo;t skim data, and
so to let someone join, you just give them the password.</li>
<li>Locking PDFs or other documents so they can only be accessed by people you give the password to.</li>

<li>If it&rsquo;s used for communication, everyone involved needs to share the secret password beforehand,
if they want their communication to be secure.</li>
<li>Because in many cases, people are encouraged to share the password (like with WiFi), it&rsquo;s more
likely for someone bad to get access.</li>
<li>Because the key can be shared around, you can&rsquo;t tell if someone you&rsquo;re communicating with is who
they say they are.</li>

It&rsquo;s less efficient than
symmetric encryption in terms of CPU usage, but it has a few benefits. There are a few scenarios,
however, where symmetric encryption just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. Say you need encryption between two parties
(think you and your online bank) but we don&rsquo;t have a symmetric key agreed upon to encrypt our communications. We can&rsquo;t send it,
because then anyone snooping will have the key and be able to decrypt our data anyway. We need a way
to talk secretly without agreeing on anything beforehand.</p>
<p>Enter asymmetric encryption and RSA. RSA is just an implementation of asymmetric encryption, but
it&rsquo;s currently the best. It is to asymmetric encryption as AES is to symmetric encryption.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that, unlike AES, our &ldquo;key&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a password, it&rsquo;s actually a file. Or
rather, a pair of files. Asymmetric encryption has 2 &ldquo;keys&rdquo;, a private, and a public. The private
key, unlike a symmetric encryption password, shouldn&rsquo;t be shared, and should be closely guarded.
The public key, on the other hand, can be given out freely to anyone. In fact, it should be.</p>
<p>The best way to understand how this works is to see it in action, so I&rsquo;ll show how to do it, and
comment as we go along.</p>

example, allowing a law enforcement officer with a warrant to tap into encrypted communication is simply
not feasible. Let&rsquo;s contrast keeping something safe with encryption versus keeping it safe with a
lock. People like to make this comparison, but it&rsquo;s not really apt. Locks live in the world of
physics, and while the lock itself may be secure, it&rsquo;s still vulnerable to physics - you can get
through it in any number of ways. Obviously, you could steal the key, but it&rsquo;s not easy and risks
identifying an attacker. You could pick the lock, you could blow it off with explosives, or cut
through the locking mechanism.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note is that stealing a physical key makes
it likely for the perpetrator to be noticed by the owner, picking a lock is conspicuous and
suspicious, and of course explosives or power tools will draw eyes. Cyberattackers don&rsquo;t have to
deal with this so much. Attacks can be conspicuous, or they can be covert - but most cyberattackers
can attack very, <em>very</em> quietly if they want to (at least compared to explosives 😉). Basically,
if you&rsquo;re going to compare it to something physical, imagine that every theif could turn invisible.</p>
<p>Encryption doesn&rsquo;t work through physics, or through trust - it works through mathematics. It&rsquo;s not
vulnerable to physics or workarounds. If you want a physical metaphor, it&rsquo;d be like, instead of
having a lock on your filing cabinet, having a wand that can turn it into an unbreakable rock. No
one else can change it back from a rock. No one can even tell it used to be a filing cabinet.
Thousands of invisible thieves can all gather around and try to figure it out for weeks or even
years on end, and they won&rsquo;t be able to open the metaphorical rock.</p>
<p>That felt like a silly metaphor, but here&rsquo;s the thing - there&rsquo;s no true physical analogue of
encryption. I&rsquo;ll make one more attempt. It&rsquo;s like tapping the phone conversation of the only two
people in the world who know a secret language. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how long you watch it, you won&rsquo;t
figure out what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Putting a back door in encryption, a way to &ldquo;tap&rdquo; digital encrypted communications, would be an
insane logistical nightmare to begin with. Why?</p>
<p>First off, making it illegal would be incredibly
ineffective. As I mentioned, powerful encryption is open-source. This means that, even if there&rsquo;s
nowhere you can download the openssl executable, you could make it yourself. Going back to the magic
rock metaphor, this is like if everyone had the ability to create magic rock wands at will. Even if
they wiped every trace of it from the main internet (insanely difficult), it would be all over the
place on the dark net (a hyper-secure part of the internet famously used for online drugs/weapons
vending, exchange of illegal services, and anonymous escrow bank accounts). It would be about as
difficult as banning profanity in a society where everyone wore masks 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Second, every bank, company, and blog would need to upend their security infrastructure. This would
take years to roll out (at best) and cost billions of dollars (at best).</p>
<p>Third, it puts all security at a single point of failure. A single mistake by a government employee
could ruin everything. As I mentioned, the weakness that encryption and locks both share is that
someone could steal the key. But it&rsquo;s even more dangerous because, since an encryption key is data,
it can be copied without signs of tampering. If it was stolen, it&rsquo;s likely no one would know. Even
if they did, it can be shared among friends, then friends of friends, then posted on the internet
somewhere. Trust in private communication is <del>eroded</del> annhilated. The government has to release
a new key and every company and individual in the country has to switch over - bringing us back to
point 2. No one trusts that their bank communication is confidential. Or their WiFi. Or their
Facebook login. There is no privacy on the internet. There are no secrets. Any time you type in a
password, you may as well be painting it on the side of a bus. The internet dies. The industry
tanks. We enter a second great depression, and technology regresses decades. The criminals,
terrorists, and hackers all laugh, because they never stopped using true encryption, because <em>why
would they.</em></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why encryption is important.</p>
