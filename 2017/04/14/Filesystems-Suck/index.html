        File systems are organized hierarchically. This makes sense, and is somewhat
intuitive to use. This is how your computer works. Everything is organized
relative to the &ldquo;root directory&rdquo; (/ on Mac/Linux/BSD, C:\ on Windows). Every
document, every executable, every system file is organized somewhere in that
hierarchy. It&rsquo;s how personal computers have worked for almost as long as we&rsquo;ve
had file systems on them. To those who are computer-savvy, or who grew up with
computers, this makes complete sense. Of course they&rsquo;re hierarchical - you have
folders and subfolders to organize things, you have things separated by purpose,
it makes for a powerful organizational tool.

        <p>File systems are organized hierarchically. This makes sense, and is somewhat
intuitive to use. This is how your computer works. Everything is organized
relative to the &ldquo;root directory&rdquo; (/ on Mac/Linux/BSD, C:\ on Windows). Every
document, every executable, every system file is organized somewhere in that
hierarchy. It&rsquo;s how personal computers have worked for almost as long as we&rsquo;ve
had file systems on them. To those who are computer-savvy, or who grew up with
computers, this makes complete sense. Of course they&rsquo;re hierarchical - you have
folders and subfolders to organize things, you have things separated by purpose,
it makes for a powerful organizational tool.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re the wrong way to do it. It makes sense for the engineers who built
the systems - it&rsquo;s easy and straightforward. But this idea comes from when
computers were machines of science and war - not the personal computers we use
today. The truth is, this way of doing things simply doesn&rsquo;t make sense anymore.</p>
<p>I sense some of you are angry or confused with me. But hear me out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off with showing why and how this way of organizing files has failed,
mostly with examples.</p>
<h2 id="more-information-about-the-topic" class="relative group">More Information About the Topic <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#more-information-about-the-topic" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>File systems are the building blocks of files. It keeps track of what space is
used and what isn&rsquo;t, where files begin and end, and where everything is located.
The fundamental ideas of file systems are fairly common, and work similarly no
matter what operating system you&rsquo;re on. Of course, there are lots of different
implementations of this functionality. If you&rsquo;re on Windows, you use NTFS. If
you&rsquo;re on a mac (or iOS device, for that matter), it runs on HFS+. If you&rsquo;re on
Linux, you most likely use Ext3 or Ext4.</p>
<p>For the record, NTFS and HFS+ are both outdated and lag behind their Linux
counterparts. Apple is supposed to release a new file system this year, called
APFS, that has some neat features, but in many ways it still falls short of the
counterparts offered for Linux.</p>
<p>You <em>need</em> a file system, at least under the hood. Without it, you have no idea
which physical parts of your hard drive are used and which ones aren&rsquo;t. You
don&rsquo;t know when a file was last edited, how big it is, or where it is. It&rsquo;s
impossible to use a computer without one. But does it need to be exposed to the
user? Maybe, but probably not as much as it is.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that a lot of what I talk about here is already how iOS and
Android work, at least to some extent, and I took a lot of inspiration from
both their successes and shortcomings. While their methods still fall short of
where they could be, I still believe that they&rsquo;re a good milestone.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll explain in simple terms what a database is. This is kind of
tricky. Basically, it&rsquo;s just a way of storing a lot of data, and keeping track
of the relationships between data. For example, if we want to keep track of a
list of houses, who lives in those houses, and what their names are, a database
could do that. The easiest way to think about it is that a database is Basically
a big Excel spreadsheet. You can put a ton of data in it. For each bit of
information, you have a column (Address, Name, phone number in our example
above). Each row is another entry, with another person. We can also filter or
sort our entries by any of the columns too.</p>

<p>We all know someone whose desktop looks like this. Hell, I&rsquo;d barely blame you -
the hierarchical structure of the file system basically encourages it. One of
the basic principles of engineering a good user experience is this: <em>minimize the
number of clicks for a user to do what they want to do</em>. Saving files to the
desktop is the easiest way to do this. Want to open that
word document you were working on? There it is. Don&rsquo;t have to open up a file
explorer, or remember where you saved it - it&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>But I have a lot to say, so I&rsquo;ll keep this brief. The point of a hierarchical
file system is, supposedly, to keep things organized. This is the opposite of
that. And why does this flourish? Because the file system encourages people to
do this. It encourages people to be disorganized, in favor of convenience.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-alfred-and-quicksilver" class="relative group">Example 2. Alfred and QuickSilver <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#example-2-alfred-and-quicksilver" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Alfred and QuickSilver are mac apps, that allow you an easy to search your files
and do some basic things. They were around before Apple revamped Spotlight to
serve the same purpose. QuickSilver has been around for over 6 years, and it and
Alfred were wildly popular in some circles, because of how much easier they made
things. They solved the same problem that putting everything on the desktop
solved - making files and applications easy to find and open.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how these work: Press cmd-space (or on Windows, the Windows-key) and
start typing. Once you type enough of the app or file name, it pops up in
search, and you hit enter. Bam, you opened a file with 0 clicks and a few
keystrokes.</p>
<p>This makes it easier to stay organized, because opening a file is easy,
regardless of how deep in the file system it is. But it&rsquo;s another symptom of
the problem - the fact that it was needed in the first place indicates a
problem.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-because-i-always-follow-the-rule-of-three" class="relative group">Example 3. Because I Always Follow the Rule of Three <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#example-3-because-i-always-follow-the-rule-of-three" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28writing%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Seriously, it&rsquo;s built into me. I have to.</a></p>
<p>For this, you&rsquo;ll need to understand what a
<a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/abbe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">symbolic link</a> is. It&rsquo;s basically a more powerful
version of Windows shortcuts or Mac aliases, that works particularly well for
folders. Basically, you tell the computer &ldquo;Okay, when I say Documents/photos,
just redirect me to my Photos folder&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For this example, I&rsquo;ll talk about how I organize my files.
I&rsquo;m obsessive with my file organization. I&rsquo;ve
got subfolder after subfolder, everything carefully named, everything in its
proper place. No clutter. Basically the opposite of my home office. Then, I&rsquo;ve
got dozens of symlinks pointing to related
folders (for example, my senior
design code belongs both in the &ldquo;MSOE&rdquo; folder and the &ldquo;Code&rdquo; folder) so that
everything is accessible from anywhere that makes sense. Then dozens more,
carefully thought out, to offer good convenience while still minimizing clutter.
Basically, I try hard to keep a clean and functional file system.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take just my Documents folder as an example. I have 0 files there, but
19 folders. 4 of those folders are hidden, because apps put stuff there and I
couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it. Another 4 of the folders are symbolic links, because
either the OS does something that I have to work around, or it&rsquo;s deeper in my
file tree and I want shortcuts. One of those folders is google drive. For each
subfolder in google drive, I have a symlink somewhere else pointing to it so I
can make it accessible from a logical place. Some software wants to put folders
in Documents, when it doesn&rsquo;t belong there, so I make a workaround. Sometimes
compatibility makes things act weird ways (like Google Drive) so I symlink my
way around it. My point is, in order to organize my files logically,
hierarchically, and accessibly, I need to use special commands and knowledge
that the average user just doesn&rsquo;t have. All to make the file system work
nicely.</p>
<p>That is not the hallmark of a good system.</p>
<p>I believe that my way of organizing my file system among the most elegant, and
one of the best I&rsquo;ve seen. I&rsquo;m really quite proud of it, but even then, I still
feel it&rsquo;s often quite ugly and hacky due to its constraints.</p>
<h2 id="technical-reasons" class="relative group">Technical Reasons <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#technical-reasons" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>There are also technical reasons why this method of document management is
flawed. The most obvious is viruses. Say you download some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RansomWare</a>. It starts encrypting
all your documents, and BAM! you&rsquo;ve lost everything. This only works because
since the process is running in your name, the file system lets it access all
of your files, without asking any questions. Say the RansomWare was disguised as
a game - does it make sense for a game to open word documents? Absolutely not.
But in the file system, they&rsquo;re not distinguished in any way, so it can do it.
That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t really get RansomWare on iOS and Android devices - if they
want to access your word documents, or your photos, or anything, they have to
ask you for permission. Mobile devices already implement what I&rsquo;m talking about
here.</p>

<p>So while we&rsquo;re talking about mobile devices, let&rsquo;s bring up another point.
On your phone, where are your photos located? Easy, in the Photos app. On your
computer, where are your photos located? Probably all sorts of different places.
In my opinion, this is why tablets and especially iOS devices are easier for the
less tech-savvy crowd. Things aren&rsquo;t organized hierarchically, but by
application. Want to open a word document? Open word. A photo? Open Photos. A
photoshop file? Open photoshop. The entire hierarchy is abstracted away from the
user. It&rsquo;s been <em>proven</em> that this is the safer and more intuitive way to do
things.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28software_engineering%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:
<em>&ldquo;In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is a technique for arranging complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 id="why-the-hierarchy-still-makes-sense" class="relative group">Why the Hierarchy Still Makes Sense <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#why-the-hierarchy-still-makes-sense" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t want to do away with it entirely. It makes sense
for computers to be organized this way, and they have been for a long time.
Computer scientists have figured out how to organize and work with it. The
world&rsquo;s servers are built on it, and it works great for that. It&rsquo;s absolutely
ideal for storing operating systems. My argument is only that, for users, the
file system is an awful way to store documents and things.</p>
<p>On Linux and BSD systems, things are really cleanly organized in this hierarchy.
<code>/bin</code> is for binaries, <code>/home</code> is where users&rsquo; home folders are, <code>/etc</code> is
where settings live, and so on. This makes sense, for the purpose it serves,
and is actually a rather elegant solution. Again, my beef is with users'
documents.</p>
<h2 id="okay-smart-guy-if-the-old-way-is-wrong-what-should-we-do" class="relative group">Okay, Smart Guy, if the Old Way is Wrong, What Should we Do? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#okay-smart-guy-if-the-old-way-is-wrong-what-should-we-do" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Thanks for asking. I&rsquo;ll admit, this is a really hard problem, for various
reasons. The most obvious is backwards-compatibility. File shares also pose a
bit of a problem, but perhaps they can stay the way they are. There&rsquo;s a
multitude of things that would make compatibility here difficult, but this post
is long as is.I&rsquo;m just going to look at how I&rsquo;d go about solving it on a single
personal computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also say that people smarter than I have tried and failed to do this.
Notably, the engineers at Apple attempted to do this with iCloud. It failed
to catch on, and just doesn&rsquo;t work very well in my opinion.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with how Apple has been approaching these problems: They
don&rsquo;t want to fundamentally change the way they do things, they just want to
sloppily tack new ideas onto the older software. The best example of this is
their (soon to be obsoleted) file system,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HFS+</a>. HFS+ is the successor to HFS,
and was basically just Apple tacking on some newer features to HFS through
ugly workarounds. It&rsquo;s somewhat infamous. When they tried to organize by app
through their iCloud platform, they did something similar.</p>
<p>If we want to make a good solution to this, we need to be original. We need to
be creative. We need to have some <em>courage</em>. While we work with half-measures
and cop-outs to complete solutions, the system we create will be found wanting.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the correct answer to this is a database. We could build
the database on top of the file system (this would actually make sense) but it
would need to be ubiquitous. Why? This would allow extremely efficient searches
of documents or apps by any criteria. Current file systems actually do something
similar, but I want to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering how I&rsquo;d deal with projects. For example, in code,
you have a whole folder full of files and assets, with lots of file types. I
have some ideas about how to address this, namely by sandboxing the files in
a single &ldquo;project&rdquo; file that&rsquo;s actually a folder (kind of like
<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/78176/how-do-mac-app-execution-files-work?rq=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">how Apple handles .apps</a>),
but I won&rsquo;t get into it here.</p>
<p>Next, we need a document manager. Actually, this would be pretty easy to write,
even just on top of the file system. With the database, this would be incredibly
powerful. If the operating system integrated it, it would be, in my opinion, the
single best file manager in existence.</p>
<p>So let me walk you through how this would work. You open up the manager, and
have a prompt in front of you. You type &ldquo;Word&rdquo;, and it shows you a list of all
of your Microsoft Word files, organized by the last time you edited them. You&rsquo;re
looking for one about a short story, so you type &ldquo;story&rdquo;. Seven files pop up,
and you press enter to open the one at the top. You don&rsquo;t know what folder it&rsquo;s
in. You don&rsquo;t care. But it&rsquo;s easy to find, and it&rsquo;s somewhere that makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-technical" class="relative group">Let&rsquo;s get Technical <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#lets-get-technical" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re non-technical, you can skip this section. If you want to try anyway,
you&rsquo;re welcome to, but may find yourself needing to look a lot up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say our database is relational, and built on top of the file system. This
is basically how the indexing in file systems already works, but we can do
better.</p>
<p>Each file has its own entry in the table. It has a path (this would have to be
updated when the file is moved, but that&rsquo;s pretty doable, at least in MacOS).
The file has a path, an extension (.png), a file type (picture). Each file type
has certain apps that are allowed to read and write it. For example, a picture
would be readable by photo managers, office software, and loads of other stuff,
and would be writable by things like photo managers and image editors. Only apps
that are registered as a type&rsquo;s reader (and approved by the user) are allowed to
read that kind of file, and the same thing for writing. If a RansomWare app
wants to encrypt all your documents, it&rsquo;s gonna have to ask you first. Ideally
apps have modular permissions (like how on iOS for any given app you can limit
what device features it can access).</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s file-path is 1-1, file extension is many-1, file-type may be
many-many (extensions may be registered to multiple apps. Stupid, but it
happens). type-readapps is many-many, and type-writeapps is many-many. If you
understand relational databases, this should make sense.</p>
<p>Obligatory &ldquo;non-relational databases would be stupid for this&rdquo; note: First, we
know the exact structure of every table (aside from path size), and it&rsquo;s very
predictable. Even if we
flesh it out and have a lot of tables, it&rsquo;ll still be very simple. Second, this
would be running on a single machine, there&rsquo;s no reason for partition tolerance.
Third, consistency and availability are both important here. Fourth, SQL is more
mature and reliable. Fifth, a well-tuned SQL system will be much more quick and
efficient. Sixth, stop trying to cop out of SQL just because it takes a bit more
forethought.</p>
<p>The files are indexed by every major field one would search on. Name, create
date, mod date, add date, read date, name, extension, file type, etc. I&rsquo;d need
to do a lot of analysis to figure out what compound indexes we&rsquo;d want, but you
get the idea (I hope).</p>
<p>The database, when presented with a document name, simply searches the
files, which are of course, indexed by name. Easy and fast. Document type? Join
the files with their types and filter on that. Extension? Even easier. App?
Join app, read list, file type, and file, filtered by app. Easy.</p>
<p>We could even have our own &ldquo;folder&rdquo; system, based around tags. Tag it with
&ldquo;school&rdquo; to go in the school folder. This also bypasses the problem of
hierarchical file systems not being able to share a document between folders.</p>
<h2 id="some-credit-to-mobile-operating-systems" class="relative group">Some Credit to Mobile Operating Systems <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#some-credit-to-mobile-operating-systems" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Mobile operating systems had an opportunity to try doing things a new way,
because they didn&rsquo;t have to follow these aging paradigms. And I&rsquo;ll give credit
to them for trying something new, and something different. It&rsquo;s still a young
method to managing files, but I believe it&rsquo;s maturing, and I believe that it
more or less holds the keys to the future.</p>
<h2 id="closing" class="relative group">Closing <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#closing" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Now, I&rsquo;m no user experience expert. But the traditional way is outdated, and
worse, promotes bad practices. It&rsquo;s time to rethink how we do things in an age
where computers are consumer products, and not arcane machines operated by
specialists. With the rise of touchscreen devices, we&rsquo;re seeing lots of new
ideas in this area, and I hope in the near future we&rsquo;ll move on to a better
system. Maybe you disagree with me. Actually, that&rsquo;s pretty likely. But consider
what I&rsquo;ve said here, and keep an open mind. No system is perfect, but the simple
fact is that the file system is from an age before the personal computer, and,
in my opinion, we&rsquo;re trying to put round pegs in square holes here.</p>
<p>Computer science has sped along at lightspeed over the last few decades. One
of the downsides of that is that we&rsquo;ve wound up with a lot of weird ways of
doing things just because of backwards compatibility. As our field grows
further, we need to find new and more efficient ways of doing things, and to
fix our mistakes, as difficult as that may be.</p>
<p>Maybe you disagree with me on this point, and you may even be correct. But the
above is what&rsquo;s more important. We need fresh ideas, and open minds, about how
to do things both old and new. The software engineering field is less than
100 years old (C is only 45 years old), and in a field this young, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always
been this way&rdquo; just isn&rsquo;t a good excuse.</p>
