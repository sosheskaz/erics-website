        There&rsquo;ve been various articles going around about Apple&rsquo;s batteries in iPhones, or, specifically,
Apple&rsquo;s throttling of phones&rsquo; hardware with older batteries. This post seeks to be primarily
informational, but if you&rsquo;re the owner of such a device that might be throttled, I&rsquo;ll put in some

        <p>There&rsquo;ve been various articles going around about Apple&rsquo;s batteries in iPhones, or, specifically,
Apple&rsquo;s throttling of phones&rsquo; hardware with older batteries. This post seeks to be primarily
informational, but if you&rsquo;re the owner of such a device that might be throttled, I&rsquo;ll put in some
useful information for you at the end of the post. But mostly, I&rsquo;m going to be looking at the facts
of the issue, since the internet in general and news in particular tends more towards
sensationalism than complete information.</p>
<p>The main place I&rsquo;m getting information from is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MacRumors</a>. While that
sounds like a biased source, in my experience they do their best to provide fair, nuanced, and
informational coverage, rather than the fanboyism associated with many Apple-focused news sites.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="accusations-of-throttling" class="relative group">Accusations of Throttling <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#accusations-of-throttling" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>In truth, this story has roots going further back than just this story, and the two can get
confused because they brooch similar topics, but are actually separate issues. What I&rsquo;m talking
about in particular is that Apple has been accused of intentionally slowing down older devices with
new iOS updates.</p>
<p>It should come as a surprise to no one that Apple primarily develops iOS with their newest devices
in mind. This is generally a good thing – having the second camera on the 7 Plus, or the FaceID
sensor on the X would be completely pointless without making software to drive it. Part of the
hardware improvements made over time are CPU changes, which increase the overall &ldquo;power&rdquo; of the
phone, as well as its energy efficiency. iPhone CPU improvements have been very dramatic, growing
dramatically year-by-year.</p>

<p>Source: Apple (though these figures are relatively representative of real performance gains)</p>
<p>Energy efficiency has grown similarly. With much more computational power available, for a much
lower battery hit, it&rsquo;s natural for developers to use more power for both low-level tasks and to
engage in more intensive tasks at the high end. What this means is that basic things, like the home
screen, use more energy with every iteration of the software, just because it&rsquo;s <em>doing more stuff</em>.
This means an older phone will struggle more with each iteration of iOS. This is both <em>by-design</em>
on Apple&rsquo;s part, to upsell the newer model, as well as a natural consequence of Apple&rsquo;s business
model. The alternative is more like the Android market, where many phones don&rsquo;t support upgrading
to the latest versions of the operating system. This is a difference in how each market works, and
each has benefits (keeping up-to-date with the latest features vs. more stable performance over
time).</p>
<p>Evidence gathered has suggested that Apple is not <em>intentionally</em> slowing down older phones, but
that the natural progression of the software itself has caused slowdowns, as I was describing. This
is a separate issue from the battery-based controversy now happening.</p>
<h2 id="the-battery-controversy" class="relative group">The Battery Controversy <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-battery-controversy" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>So now on to the new controversy, that unlike the previously-mentioned one, has strong evidence
supporting it, as well as Apple actually confirming their activity. Much of the defense of Apple
here is supplied by Apple themselves, explaining why they&rsquo;re doing what they are, but because it&rsquo;s
more or less impossible to confirm or deny their statements (since they have data that the public
simply doesn&rsquo;t). What we do know for certain is that Apple is intentionally slowing down some older
phones using iOS updates.</p>
<p>It was uncovered that, as of iOS 10.2.1, interesting patterns were occurring in the benchmark (a
measurement of a computer or phone&rsquo;s computing power). Basically, there were spikes in the
frequency of phones performing in specific ranges, rather than along a more natural curve.</p>

<p>The left graph is of performance of a number iPhone 6s devices prior to iOS 10.2.1, while the one
on the right is after. The horizontal axis is performance scores, while the vertical access is the
number of phones getting that score. What we see in the second graph is that there are unnatural
groupings along certain points – points that Apple is throttling some phones to.</p>
<p>Apple has admitted to the throttling, so this isn&rsquo;t just speculation, this is fact backed up by
experimentation.</p>
<p>But what <strong>is</strong> notable, is that Apple is not throttling all devices equally, which is what I
believe they would do if they were just trying to upsell phones with this maneuver. This backs
up their story.</p>
<h3 id="apples-story" class="relative group">Apple&rsquo;s Story <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#apples-story" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Apple claims that the throttling was introduced as a strategy of power management in older phones.
Put simply, as the battery degrades over time (as Lithium-Ion batteries do), this causes some
issues in the electronics. Batteries can run out faster than they &ldquo;should&rdquo;, because they can no
longer hold as much charge. More seriously, degradation of the battery can cause more serious
issues. For example, the battery can fail to provide enough power to run a CPU at full blast,
causing brownouts when performing intensive tasks. The battery can swell and put pressure on other
components, causing them to malfunction. And of course, the readings can become faulty.</p>
<p>Some of you may be rolling your eyes at this claim, but it is <strong>true</strong>. I say that using my own
personal experience. I own a laptop with such a degraded battery, and it can suddenly power off at
40%-50% charge when performing intensive tasks for exactly this reason. Believe me, it sucks to be
in the middle of compiling code and have your laptop cut out.</p>
<p>Personally, I suspect that Apple has had some poor quality management of their sourced batteries
for a while, based on the variety of incidents surrounding Apple&rsquo;s batteries lately (I am not the
only person with this problem with this model of laptop).</p>

Frankly, I hope that they receive a favorable result, because I feel
that Apple&rsquo;s behavior here is unacceptable, for reasons I&rsquo;ll explain shortly. The argument of this
lawsuit is that Apple neither gave notice, nor any choice, to any users whose phones were
throttled. This was done silently, with no meaningful consent, to people who <strong>own</strong> their
products. I don&rsquo;t know enough about law to know whether this has any merit anymore, but while I
don&rsquo;t necessarily feel that the throttling was <em>wrong</em> exactly, I find Apple&rsquo;s approach to it
lacking and concerning.</p>

<p>A chemically aged battery also becomes less capable of delivering peak energy loads, especially in a low state of charge, which may result in a device unexpectedly shutting itself down in some situations.
To help customers learn more about iPhone&rsquo;s rechargeable battery and the factors affecting its performance, we&rsquo;ve posted a new support article, iPhone Battery and Performance.
It should go without saying that we think sudden, unexpected shutdowns are unacceptable. We don&rsquo;t want any of our users to lose a call, miss taking a picture or have any other part of their iPhone experience interrupted if we can avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: Apple</p>
<p>Apple has responded to this in a few ways. First, they owned up to, and justified, the things they
did. Secrecy and denial was the wrong approach here, and I&rsquo;m glad Apple was (in my opinion) honest
in that regard. Second, they&rsquo;ve committed to making changes in iOS to be more transparent in
regard to this particular issue. Namely, they plan to give more insight into the present health of
an iPhone&rsquo;s battery at any given point, and make that information available on demand. <em>They should
have done this a long time ago</em>. MacOS has features to tell you the health of your battery, and
third-party apps that do the same. iOS should too. Finally, they&rsquo;re reducing the price of a battery
replacement from $79 to $29, so if you&rsquo;re affected by this, I recommend taking advantage (if you&rsquo;re
not planning on leaving the Apple ecosystem in response to this).</p>
<h3 id="my-insight" class="relative group">My Insight <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#my-insight" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>As someone who has experienced the battery issues (unexpected shutdowns) that Apple alluded to (as
well as much worse), let me just say that, despite what you may think, throttling the CPU when on
battery power is <em>vastly</em> preferable.</p>
<p>However, what they did was unacceptable. Why? Because there had to be <em>public outrage</em> before they
were the least bit transparent about it. Damn it Apple, your customers are <em>adults</em>. Throttling the
phones themselves is one thing, but without doing anything to inform your customers? Seriously?
That&rsquo;s one of the most contemptuous moves towards your customers you&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, you like what Apple did, but not how they did it? How should they have done it then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: You, maybe</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Apple could have <em>easily</em> done this in a palatable way, using any (or all) of my
suggestions here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before throttling a phone, display an alert to a user. The alert could say something like: &ldquo;Your
battery has degraded, and the performance of the device will be reduced. This is to prevent
unexpected shutdowns, substantially decreased battery life, and other issues. It&rsquo;s recommended to
get a battery replacement. See [linked article] for more details.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Alert users when their battery has degraded, and tell them how bad it is.</li>
<li>Make the health of the battery easily accessible (to their credit, they are doing this, but it&rsquo;s
too late in my opinion)</li>
<li>Tell your users <em>how much</em> their phone is being throttled.</li>
<li>Detect a degraded battery and display an alert with information on <strong>how</strong> to get a battery
repair.</li>
</ul>
<p>There. There&rsquo;s 5 ideas on how to have not turned this into a complete and utter PR <strong>disaster</strong>.</p>
<p>So yes. I think that the throttling is a good thing, but the way that Apple did it is utterly
distasteful, shows contempt for their users, and is consumer-unfriendly.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-affected-by-the-throttling-or-am-concerned-that-i-may-be-affected" class="relative group">I am Affected by the Throttling, or am Concerned that I May be Affected <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#i-am-affected-by-the-throttling-or-am-concerned-that-i-may-be-affected" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Alright, the promised &ldquo;what to do&rdquo; section. While I&rsquo;m staying in the Apple ecosystem for now, I
don&rsquo;t blame anyone who jumps ship at this point. This is potentially an indicator of bad things to
come, and honestly, you should ask yourself if you want to stay invested in a company that did
something like this. You may choose, like I did, to stick around, but it is at the very least
something you should ask yourself.</p>
<h3 id="wait-until-the-january-ios-update" class="relative group">Wait until the January iOS Update <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#wait-until-the-january-ios-update" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>In January, Apple will release an update to iOS that will allow you to see more detailed
information about your battery&rsquo;s health. That information may be useful to making a decision about
what to do, and if you&rsquo;re uncertain about whether you&rsquo;re affected, it should hopefully provide some
insight.</p>

new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">support article</a> to educate yourself a bit further.
Just keep in mind that you <strong>are</strong> reading something from the company itself that may have inherent
bias or points to make. If you played with DC circuits in high school or college (and still
remember it) you will probably understand most or all of what they talk about. If not, you should
still be able to follow it and understand what they&rsquo;re getting at.</p>

The insight that phones
with older batteries are being throttled may make it a good time to switch to a new phone. If you
want to stay in the Apple camp, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are well-liked (though I still feel that
the X is too new/untested for a reliable main phone). If you want to switch to Android, the Google
Pixel 2 is by all accounts a loved phone (if you can get over the fact that
Goo-We-Make-Our-Money-By-Essentially-Selling-Your-Data-To-Advertisers-gle makes it).</p>

$29, as opposed to the current $79. This is a pretty good deal. If, once the iOS update with the
new battery health features drops, your device could use a repair (threshold is below 80% health
for Macs, I&rsquo;d expect similar), I&rsquo;d look into getting it serviced.</p>
<h3 id="talk-to-apple-support" class="relative group">Talk to Apple Support <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#talk-to-apple-support" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>There&rsquo;s nothing like a real human to answer questions and concerns, and to give you a hand.
Personally, I like live chat, because it can be done passively (while watching TV or whatever), it
gives support time to more naturally look up information, and doesn&rsquo;t have <em>hold music</em>. I&rsquo;d hold
off on this, just because there&rsquo;s not that much they can do until the iOS changes are rolled out
and the price of battery servicing is reduced. As always with tech support, you&rsquo;ll get the best
service by remaining calm, cooperating fully, and answering questions clearly and with detail. Keep
in mind that they had no choice over Apple&rsquo;s approach here. Here&rsquo;s how to get there:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">support website</a>.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Batteries, Power, and Charging&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Battery Questions or Troubleshooting&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Chat&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll be connected to someone within a couple minutes (in my experience).</li>
