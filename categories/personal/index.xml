      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I just graduated college with a B.S. in software engineering, I think it&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;a good time to look back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-years&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;The Early Years &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#the-early-years&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, some of my first exposure to computers was the computers the school&#xA;had that we were sometimes allowed to play with after school. They had a few&#xA;games on them, mostly edutainment games designed to help kids learn arithmetic,&#xA;practice reading, and things like that. The most popular one was a game where&#xA;you were racing, and the more math problems you did, the faster your car went.&#xA;I liked to play one of the reading ones. The people watching us showed us the&#xA;games at first, then would sit back as we did our own thing, playing the games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
