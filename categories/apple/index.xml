      <title>Apple&#39;s Gather Round - 12 September 2018</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, I have to start out by commenting on how well-shot the opening sequence is. Great use&#xA;of lighting and camera angles. Though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly funny or appropriate, it really is&#xA;great from a technical standpoint to the point that even someone as pedestrian as me can see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;iphone&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;iPhone &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#iphone&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three new models of iPhone were announced - the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. At least the silly tone&#xA;of Apple&amp;rsquo;s opening video matches the silly naming of these phones - sounding like they&amp;rsquo;re supposed&#xA;to be sports cars. What&amp;rsquo;s that? You say it&amp;rsquo;s a roman numeral, and the way to say it is &amp;ldquo;ten&amp;rdquo;? Sorry,&#xA;but you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. The tenth iPhone was the iPhone 7, and in Apple&amp;rsquo;s naming scheme, they skipped 9,&#xA;so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why X would be a 10. Fight me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apple&#39;s WWDC - 4 June 2018</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again – Apple&amp;rsquo;s World-Wide Developer Conference. The first day, June 4, Apple&#xA;announces new software, and sometimes new hardware, that will be upcoming around Q3 of the year. I&amp;rsquo;m&#xA;here to break down and summarize what they&amp;rsquo;re releasing and what I expect it to actually look like&#xA;once it&amp;rsquo;s released. This year&amp;rsquo;s WWDC was expected to have less major changes than in the past, as&#xA;Apple just made major hardware announcements and changes last year, as well as because this year&#xA;(according to rumor) they&amp;rsquo;ve been largely focused on internal improvements in terms of performance&#xA;and bugfixes over adding on new features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What&#39;s Going on with Apple&#39;s Batteries?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;ve been various articles going around about Apple&amp;rsquo;s batteries in iPhones, or, specifically,&#xA;Apple&amp;rsquo;s throttling of phones&amp;rsquo; hardware with older batteries. This post seeks to be primarily&#xA;informational, but if you&amp;rsquo;re the owner of such a device that might be throttled, I&amp;rsquo;ll put in some&#xA;useful information for you at the end of the post. But mostly, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be looking at the facts&#xA;of the issue, since the internet in general and news in particular tends more towards&#xA;sensationalism than complete information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple just did another event where they announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, among other things.&#xA;Because I am as predictable as the flame wars about whether or not the event was any good, I&amp;rsquo;m here&#xA;to give the highlights about the event so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to watch the whole 2-hour keynote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-iphones&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk About iPhones &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#lets-talk-about-iphones&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next generation of iPhones is here, with the iPhone X and iPhone 8. And, as usual, the old model&#xA;is available for slightly cheaper than previously. However, unlike previous years, the iPhone 6S has&#xA;stuck around, and is selling starting at $449. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re strapped for cash and want a full-size&#xA;iPhone, now is a good time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Otherwise, feel free to skip to the next&#xA;section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my new job (I just graduated) as a professional software engineer, I got&#xA;my hands on a 2016 MacBook Pro as my personal machine. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested to&#xA;get a look at this machine for quite a while, and now that I do have one, I&amp;rsquo;m&#xA;going to go over my first impressions, and in particular looking at how I feel&#xA;about many of the hardware changes that were introduced in this generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to write this, Apple&amp;rsquo;s 2017 World Wide Developer Conference keynote has just wrapped up.&#xA;And what a big conference it was. Tim Cook said it was the biggest one they&amp;rsquo;ve ever done - and for once,&#xA;that may not be hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In science and engineering, there are two kinds of breakthroughs. The one we most often think of is the&#xA;creation of new technology. And while that is certainly important, the advances that really change things&#xA;are the ones that don&amp;rsquo;t bring about a new technology, but that make it accessible. Apple&amp;rsquo;s original claim&#xA;to fame with its line of computers was the color display. Color displays had been around for a long time&#xA;back then, but Apple&amp;rsquo;s game changer was that they made it &lt;em&gt;affordable&lt;/em&gt; for common people. The advances we&#xA;see here aren&amp;rsquo;t so much about affordability, however, as they are accessibility; they&amp;rsquo;ve taken&#xA;well-established technologies and integrated them in such a way that they&amp;rsquo;ve become accessible - putting&#xA;these technologies in the hands of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>March 21 2017 Apple Press Release Coverage</title>
      <link>https://www.ericsweb.site/2017/03/23/Apple-Press-Release-Coverage/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ericsweb.site/2017/03/23/Apple-Press-Release-Coverage/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple put out a press release on Monday, announcing a few minor new products. I&amp;rsquo;m here to cover what they did, and what&#xA;I think of it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also say that I&amp;rsquo;m aggregating a lot from &lt;a href=&#34;https://macrumors.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34;&gt;MacRumors&lt;/a&gt;, which is a website&#xA;with Apple news and, in my opinion, is the fairest and has the highest journalistic integrity of the mainstream Apple&#xA;news aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-now-lower-end-ipad&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;1. Now Lower-End iPad &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#1-now-lower-end-ipad&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple released a new lower-end iPad. It&amp;rsquo;s replacing the iPad Air 2, which has become a bit outdated. Most notably, in my&#xA;opinion, its price point has dropped from $399 to $329, making it Apple&amp;rsquo;s cheapest tablet offering. It&amp;rsquo;s got a few minor&#xA;technical updates. It&amp;rsquo;s running the new(er) A9 chip, which is a substantial improvement from the previous A8X. However,&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s notable that it&amp;rsquo;s not using the A9X chips the iPad Pros use, and this is probably one of the main reasons for the&#xA;price drop. It&amp;rsquo;s also got a brighter display, and is about an ounce heavier (32 grams). If you want an iPad, now is a&#xA;good time to buy, thanks to the price drop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apple, Muster your Courage. It&#39;s time for USB-C.</title>
      <link>https://www.ericsweb.site/2017/03/16/iPad-USB-C/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched your progress over the last few years with interest. As a fan, follower, and analyst, I&#xA;feel I need to call you out on it when you&amp;rsquo;re making a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;rsquo;re making a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;USB-C is the future. You know this. It&amp;rsquo;s why your new laptops have solely USB-C (and despite what the haters&#xA;say, that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing). So it&amp;rsquo;s time to muster your famous &lt;em&gt;courage&lt;/em&gt;, and follow through on that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 Things I Like About Swift</title>
      <link>https://www.ericsweb.site/2017/02/23/3-Things-About-Swift/</link>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the past several months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working a lot in Swift 3 and XCode 8. The language was a brand&#xA;new experience for me, and there was quite a learning curve. I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked with a language like it and&#xA;while, as always, programming skills carry over, the syntax of Swift proved tricky. However, after this time,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve either gained an appreciation for some of the more novel features in Swift, or else I&amp;rsquo;ve gained&#xA;stockholm syndrome. Determining which is left as an exercise to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This refresh has long&#xA;been asked for in Apple circles, after the line has gone stale. It seems to me that Apple has largely transitioned away&#xA;from its computer line, treating them more as accessories to iPhone devices than as standalone products. It seems to me&#xA;that the new iterations of MacBooks are largely informed by this philosophy, in that they&amp;rsquo;re coming in with lower power&#xA;requirements, a smaller footprint, and longer battery life. They&amp;rsquo;re also coming with a larger price tag, something that&#xA;definitely has not been received well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;T is Tim Cook. All others&amp;rsquo; positions are inferred by context. This is just a fun little script I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;T: &amp;ldquo;We need better photo quality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A: &amp;ldquo;Really? I think users care more about-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sniper Apple keeps across the street to monitor its engineers takes out A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B: &amp;ldquo;Photo quality is my top priority!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;T: &amp;ldquo;Okay, good. What can we do about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B: &amp;ldquo;Well, people like zooming in, but digital zoom sucks. We could work on that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>09/07 Apple Event Coverage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my regular coverage of the Apple event now that I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on it a few days, broken into relevant subsections:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;apple-watch&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Apple Watch: &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#apple-watch&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Added a new iteration, called &amp;ldquo;Series 2&amp;rdquo;, and one that&amp;rsquo;s basically the same but with a processor update, &amp;ldquo;Series 1&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Processor update to both. Nothing truly substantial, but it will help future-proof it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Series 2 is waterproof and has built-in GPS. This makes it more usable for fitness without an iPhone nearby.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Series 2 has a much brighter display, for better in-sun visibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Price point for series 1 has dropped to $270. Price delta for 42/38 mm models has dropped from $50 to $30.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They got it pretty much right the first time, and there&amp;rsquo;s not a whole lot to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;iphone&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;iPhone: &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#iphone&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Substantial camera improvements. 7 has image stabilization, and 7+ has dual lenses. This means that iPhone can now physically zoom, and better correct digital zoom. Also has better image software to improve low-light shots and overall image prettiness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;End-to-end wide-color gamut support. This means you&amp;rsquo;ll get brighter, sharper colors across the board.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CPU upgrade - There&amp;rsquo;s been a massive CPU upgrade, with not just huge performance increases, but battery life increases. I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss implications later.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Loss of headphone jack - this gets its own section with in-depth analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it don&amp;rsquo;t buy it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-headphone-jack&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;The Headphone Jack &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#the-headphone-jack&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of headphone jack. You&amp;rsquo;ve heard about it. You might be mad about it. Personally, the reaction reminds me of when Apple migrated away from optical drives (or from floppy disks, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there for that). One difference is that back then I thought Apple was right to remove the optical drive - but I don&amp;rsquo;t think so here. The optical drive had a clear replacement - digital distribution. Tim Cook kind of flubbed on what we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to replace aux with, between bluetooth and lightning. Both cases had a poorly received alternative (external DVD drive / lightning-aux converter) I actually could&amp;rsquo;ve gotten behind this decision if it had been made a bit differently; delayed by maybe 1 or 2 years to address the faults. Fault 1: There is no good replacement for Aux. Bluetooth&amp;rsquo;s quality is weak - waiting for bluetooth 5.0 could&amp;rsquo;ve helped a lot. Lightning is a poor replacement for wired - it&amp;rsquo;s little used and nonstandard. I have little doubt this is a licensing power grab by Apple. Converting to USB-C would&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to their willingness to move on from outdated and obsolete technology. Fault 2: No charging while listening. It&amp;rsquo;s theorized that Apple was working on built-in wireless charging for the iPhone. If that were on the scene, this move would make a lot more sense. Given those 2 things, I think this change would be much better (although no better received). The third fault is that most of the consumer world still runs on aux, but this will still be the case 2 years from now (if Apple hadn&amp;rsquo;t made this move). USB-C would be a better audio driver than aux. It&amp;rsquo;s better than lightning. I think Apple is making a good stand, but on the wrong foot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll know it when I see it&amp;rdquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
