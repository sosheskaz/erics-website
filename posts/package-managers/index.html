        From the time I first got Linux to boot on a laptop I had, I became entranced with the idea of a
system package manager. From Wikipedia:

A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer&rsquo;s operating system in a consistent manner.
Basically, a package manager lets you install software in a uniform way - on Ubuntu Linux,
apt install 7zip. On CentOS Linux, yum install 7zip. On OpenSUSE Linux zypper install 7zip. No
more double-checking that you&rsquo;re installing it from the right source, no more &ldquo;Choose where you want
to install this&rdquo;, no more &ldquo;oh crap oh crap I forgot to uncheck the &lsquo;Install NotMalware™️ Toolbar&rsquo;&rdquo;.
Clean. Uniform. It just knows how to install it.

        <p>From the time I first got Linux to boot on a laptop I had, I became entranced with the idea of a
system <em>package manager</em>. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer&rsquo;s operating system in a consistent manner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, a package manager lets you install software in a uniform way - on Ubuntu Linux,
<code>apt install 7zip</code>. On CentOS Linux, <code>yum install 7zip</code>. On OpenSUSE Linux <code>zypper install 7zip</code>. No
more double-checking that you&rsquo;re installing it from the right source, no more &ldquo;Choose where you want
to install this&rdquo;, no more &ldquo;oh crap oh crap I forgot to uncheck the &lsquo;Install NotMalware™️ Toolbar&rsquo;&rdquo;.
Clean. Uniform. It just knows how to install it.</p>
<p>Around this time I also learned about the Mac package managers <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Homebrew</a> and
<a href="https://www.macports.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MacPorts</a>, and came to use them religiously. I used them without
thinking about what they were or how they did it, and probably assumed that they worked the same way
as the Linux ones. I just enjoyed that package managers were easy and worked, and that I had one on
my OS. It wasn&rsquo;t until I ran FreeBSD that I came to understand even the basics of how package
managers really worked.</p>
<h2 id="the-linux-answer" class="relative group">The Linux Answer <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-linux-answer" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s say we were going to build a system to do the same thing - have a simple platform that would
manage programs on a system for the user. You&rsquo;re probably thinking along the lines of one of the
various app stores out there - you, a trusted party, host all the software that people will download
in a nice, easy-to-install format, and people can download and install it as they please. All you
need is a place to host it. And in the meantime, anyone else can run their own repository of
software next to yours, and as long as they have the same format, it&rsquo;ll be fully-compatible.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a bad solution - in fact, in some ways it&rsquo;s utterly brilliant. Having a central
repository makes for lots of opportunities. You can have specific repositories curated for
compatibility against a specific version of a specific operating system. Everyone downloads from a
trusted source without having to think about it. Third parties who don&rsquo;t want to share their code
with you can host their own. If someone needs a bit of software from a  different repo, all they
have to do is subscribe to it. There are plenty of benefits.</p>
<p>But there are downsides to this approach too. There&rsquo;s a central point of failure - your servers -
if they go down, all the people using your repository are SOL. If someone won&rsquo;t let you use your
repository for their software (or you don&rsquo;t want their software (or both)), and don&rsquo;t want to host
their own - congratulations - your beautiful package manager becomes useless in that scenario.
Further there is a <strong>lot</strong> of software out there, and hosting all of it for countless people to all
use at the same time gets expensive, which is a bit of an issue if you don&rsquo;t have servers,
bandwidth, or money.</p>
<p>Though Linux didn&rsquo;t implement this sprawling infrastructure out of the gate, the basic tooling for
distributing and installing these packages was first implemented around 1994 (I&rsquo;m referring here to
the creation of <code>dpkg</code>).</p>
<p>Recently, starting in 2013, two big players arrived on the scene, with similar promises but very
different implementations - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Docker</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_%28package_manager%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Snappy</a>. Docker became the symbol of
containerization, a practice involving packaging up every single thing needed to run a piece of
software, and running it in what is basically a virtual-machine-but-not-really. Promising optimal
reliability, reproduceability, and integration with sophisticated machine orchestration tools, it&rsquo;s
become a popular and different means of addressing many older problems by taking isolation between
&ldquo;packages&rdquo; to relative extremes. Snappy, on the other hand, takes portability by building itself a
little sandbox with everything it needs and shipping that around on-demand, crossing Linux
distributions, computer architectures, and device types in the process while bypassing many of the
limitations of containerization, especially as they apply to desktop apps.</p>
<h3 id="linux-dishonorable-mentions" class="relative group">Linux Dishonorable Mentions <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#linux-dishonorable-mentions" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>None, really. The GNU folks have collectively put a lot of time and effort into building a system
that works both easily and well (most of the time -
<a href="https://twitter.com/sosheskaz/status/1047339775030702080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">looking at you, OpenSUSE</a>) and even when
the result hasn&rsquo;t been great, their hearts are usually in the right place, even if I sometimes feel
they&rsquo;re a bit too aggressive about their GNU ideology in some places.</p>
<h2 id="the-bsd-answer" class="relative group">The BSD Answer <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-bsd-answer" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>For BSD, many of those benefits were meager, and the downsides were more serious. Where Linux had
a genuine need for versatility given the vast number of different distributions and their vast
differences, BSD had relatively few public distributions and more consistency within an operating
system Where commercialized Linux distributions (or even just popular distributions that make a lot
through donations) were able to run their dedicated repositories, such a thing was non-trivial for
BSD, and an alternative that was more decentralized would be easier to implement and maintain.*</p>
<p>* I&rsquo;m making some guesses about why the ports tree was adopted based on its relative technical
merits, especially as they applied circa 1993. Honestly, I suspect it was added because it was
&ldquo;useful at the time&rdquo; and it happened to work well for their needs.</p>
<p>So instead, in 1993-1994, FreeBSD developed the beginnings of the ports tree (really called the
ports collection, but I prefer tree, because that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s structured). The basic idea was that,
instead of downloading the software itself, you&rsquo;d download the source code yourself, and compile it
for your own machine, using only a simple script called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Makefile</a>. This had the benefit of supporting multiple
architectures, without needing to compile for all of them ahead of time, and allowing changing of
advanced compilation options to suit the needs of the users and allowing greater control, all using
just the version control software (subversion) that was already widely used for collaborating on
code.</p>
<p>Over time, it was realized that ports didn&rsquo;t necessarily need to build the package from source -
after all, they were basically just arbitrary scripts in the form of
Makefiles. This meant that they could be adapted to
install proprietary software, that may not be packaged in an expected way, from an open-source
repository that you had a copy of on your machine without necessarily violating licenses.</p>
<p>Later, Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, and other open-source BSD operating systems would adopt ports trees
inspired by, or even descended from, the original FreeBSD ports tree. This wound up being a great
feature for advanced users, because of its huge flexibility and the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t dependent on
a single repository being up at any given time.</p>

<li>It took forever (2012) for FreeBSD to get a good native binary package manager. Though I prefer the ports tree, not having one can alienate new users. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s generally lacking compared to its Linux counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is offered with the caveat that the BSD community generally has less resources than the Linux
community to invest in endeavors like this. The pointless infighting between types of BSD (well,
really just FreeBSD and OpenBSD, everybody likes NetBSD) also doesn&rsquo;t help the platform as a whole.</p>

Built on top of the <code>dpkg</code> utility from Debian Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy. It downloads original source releases, patches them if necessary, configures them for Darwin and compiles and installs them. The information about available packages and the necessary patches (the &ldquo;package descriptions&rdquo;) are maintained separately, but are usually included with this distribution. The actual source code is downloaded from the Internet as necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like its Linux counterparts, it used dedicated repositories (often of source code rather than
binaries) to port, compile, install, and maintain common open-source utilities for macOS. It hooked
into many of the source code distributions already out there (including FreeBSD&rsquo;s own ports tree) in
order to install and manage software for macOS with almost none of the necessary infrastructure for
doing so, by integrating the repositories already maintained by the open-source community at large
and providing an &ldquo;adapter&rdquo; to macOS by rebuilding the Linux binaries using macOS build tools.</p>
<p>Hot on Fink&rsquo;s heels, in 2002, MacPorts was created. As the name implies, it was based on the idea
of the FreeBSD ports tree, but instead targeting macOS. Like the ports tree, it installed everything
by building from the source code, with a depth of configuration options available to suit the needs
of the user. It quickly became popular among power users and developed a following of contributors,
and to date has more packages available than any other mac package manager.</p>
<p>In 2009, the now most-popular mac package manager was announced, Homebrew. It was basically the
ultimate mutt, incorporating ideas from all the package mangers up to that point about how packages
should be managed, and had the benefit of being built on git. Its popularity took off, in 2013 being
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140207125857/https://octoverse.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the most popular repositories on GitHub</a>.
Like BSD, it used a repository of scripts to define how to install software, but as was more common
in the Linux world, it typically downloaded pre-built binaries. and supported adding additional
repositories. Like ports, it keeps local copies of all its scripts using version control tools, but
like traditional package managers, allows one to subscribe to additional repositories, and manages
those using <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">an advanced feature of git</a>. It
tries to take the best of all worlds, and in my opinion, does a damn good job of it.</p>

<li>App Store: A cynical and half-hearted attempt to bring Apple&rsquo;s iOS cash cow to the desktop while simultaneously making life more difficult for users and developers alike, and generally being a flop.</li>
<li>Swift Package Manager: Released with Swift 3.0, this package manager couples being the last to market behind CocoaPods and Carthage while simultaneously being more obtuse and less reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, it seems like Apple just can&rsquo;t wrap their heads around how to make a good package manager&hellip;
Or maybe the open-source community are the only people pure enough in purpose to be able to do so

area, but I also don&rsquo;t want to leave it out. That&rsquo;s not to denigrate the people working on it
at all - they do great work, and as someone who fell in love with package managers as soon as I
found them, the work they do on bringing package managers to an ecosystem that seems to think it&rsquo;s
too good for them is greatly appreciated. That said, nothing that&rsquo;s come out of it has been
particularly impressive or reliable when compared to the *NIX counterparts.</p>

<li>Chocolatey: The lonely missing package manager for Windows, built on top of NuGet. Like homebrew, it&rsquo;s open-source and free, but it doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere near the same community involvement (despite having comparatively massive market share 🤔) and just isn&rsquo;t as mature as those on other operating systems in terms of end-usage. It&rsquo;s a similar to homebrew in the idea of how its install scripts work, but not being built with the same flexibility via git, it just doesn&rsquo;t wind up being as strong.</li>

running some of the <code>choco</code> servers on FreeBSD. Despite saying some perhaps mean things above, I
really do admire the hard work you folks put in making a package manager for an ecosystem that&rsquo;s
just not receptive to it. It made my life loads easier when I worked in that ecosystem. Keep on

give the illusion of having learned something from this long-winded and esoteric post.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m a pretty big fan of homebrew. I&rsquo;ve long been impressed by the mac developer
community&rsquo;s tenacity in developing for the operating system - it seems ironic that one of the
operating systems that most jealously guards its walled garden ecosystem has such a rich community
of people experimenting to see what they can do with it. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of the BSD roots that
become apparent once you dive in, and this community takes on some of the properties of the other
from those shared roots. Maybe Apple&rsquo;s limitations of the system encourage innovation to get around
them, or to see how they can make the most of those constraints. Or maybe somebody just had a clever
idea that happened to grow up well, and happened to be working on a mac at the time.</p>
<p>As far as FreeBSD and the ports tree goes, it really was a satisfying and useful way of managing the
operating system. Maybe it was just my intrigue in the subject matter, but it was satisfying to
compile my own programs, attaching all the settings I wanted, choosing which libraries they used,
and manually setting them up to work just the way I wanted. I&rsquo;ve never driven a manual transmission,
I have to imagine it&rsquo;s a similar feeling to what has been described to me - getting closer to the
machine and getting a closer feel for what it&rsquo;s doing, having a greater deal of control to go along
with it. It&rsquo;s something MacPorts maintained well, but the spirit of which seems to have been lost in
homebrew on the mac side of things. Even so, I have to wonder how it&rsquo;s going to hold up as
containerization continues to evolve, and purpose-build not-quite-virtual machines become more
common, while FreeBSD gets left in the lurch because it lacks proper docker compatibility.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, containerization is getting ever bigger in my field which makes me wonder how the
split between server and desktop management of software dependencies is ultimately going to resolve
itself. Are we just going to see bigger splits, where containers running in VMs hundreds of miles
away become the new racks of servers, while stripped down carbon copies of google chrome coupled
with a handful of javascript become the new desktop apps? Or will things re-converge into some new
form that somehow takes the best of both, like homebrew did with ports trees and binary
repositories?</p>
<hr>
<p>And now, for your entertainment, Windows 95, being run raw though a javascript renderer provided by
Chromium.</p>
