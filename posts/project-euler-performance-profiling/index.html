        <p>I&rsquo;ve been sitting on a side project for a while, working on it when I have time. The project in
question is Project Euler - specifically, implementing Project Euler in a few different programming
languages. Pretty soon after starting, I realized that I had an opportunity to compare the
performance of these implementations across not only different programming languages, but also
across different ways of running the code in question and optimizing it to not just reach the right
answer, but to maximize performance in measurable ways. Most Project Euler solutions I&rsquo;ve seen
haven&rsquo;t quantified their performance in this way, and when they do optimize, usually only optimize
in favor of one metric, usually the &ldquo;Clock Time&rdquo; taken to compute the answer. Here, I&rsquo;m sitting on
a lot of data – currently, 21 problems (and a control) across 5 different programming languages,
as well as different performance approaches for the differerent languages.</p>
<p>So today, sitting in front of my grand total of 5 programming languages, expressed using 9 different
profilers, measuring 4 metrics across 22 programs, for a total of 792 data points, I have a golden
opportunity to don my lab coat and play scientist for a day, and look at the performance of several
different progrramming languages and even different runtimes for the same language.</p>
<h2 id="methodology" class="relative group">Methodology <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#methodology" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>When writing problems 1 through 20 (and 67), I generally implemented it in Golang first, then ported
the logic to other programming languages. I also avoided third-party libraries, because those track
poorly across languages and profiling strategies. I kept the overall strategy of the implementations
relatively uniform, with two exceptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a language is able to natively, cleanly, and easily parrallelize operations, I did so.</li>
<li>If a language offers language features that can simplify the implementation, I use them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first means that certain languages have an advantage in clock time, and the second means that
some implementations of languages have an advantage over the others. These advantages are
intentional, as the alternative of not using language features when available would obfuscate these
advantages.</p>
<p>Profiling is done with a custom-built binary which is used to profile tasks. It can be thought of
as being relatively close to the GNU <code>time</code> utility, simply recording and outputting the metics
reported by the kernel in a programmatically readable way. The metrics reported are user time,
system time, and maximum resident set size. In addition, it makes a &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; to record clock
time, though as this is recorded by the profiler itself and not the kernel, it is not as accurate.
The profiler takes a sample of a given number or runs, usually 10 (with the exception of the Groovy
Direct profiler, which uses 3, due to the JVM startup making it take too long). The average of these
samples is what I&rsquo;m using in the data comparisons.</p>
<p>The profiling is orchestrated by a python script, which uses docker to manage the environments in
which it&rsquo;s run. Docker ensures optimal conditions for the software, but introduces substantial
latency to the invocations. In order to offset this latency, the profiler binary mentioned above is
run from within the docker container and the metrics reported back up to the orchestrator.</p>
<p>The source code for the profiler and the orchestrator can be found
<a href="https://github.com/sosheskaz/Project-Euler/tree/b1e5e3817185f5c262321b6e368f63d8f3a5a571/perfprofile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The results are written out to JSON, YAML, and CSV. I&rsquo;m working from the CSV format, because it
maps easily into spreadsheet software for making graphs. You can find the raw data
<a href="https://github.com/sosheskaz/Project-Euler/tree/b1e5e3817185f5c262321b6e368f63d8f3a5a571/profiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
Also included therre are hardware specifications for the machine that generated this data.</p>
<h3 id="profiling-strategies" class="relative group">Profiling Strategies <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#profiling-strategies" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>I use a total of 9 different profiling strategies. Each profile strategy is a different way of
running a given problem. For the most part, they&rsquo;re simple and straightforward, but some languages
have more than one profiler, or have a profiler that gives special considerations.</p>
<h3 id="golang" class="relative group">Golang <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#golang" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Golang uses the <code>Go 1.12.3 (Compiled)</code> profiler. It compiles the go program to a binary before
running it, and does not include compilation time in the profile result. It does not use any extra
compilation options when doing so.</p>
<h3 id="groovy" class="relative group">Groovy <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#groovy" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Groovy supports two profiling strategies, <code>Groovy 2.5.6/JDK8 (NailGun)</code>, AKA Groovy Nailgun, and
<code>Groovy 2.5.6/JDK8 (Standard)</code>, AKA Groovy Direct. NailGun uses Facebook&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/nailgun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NailGun</a>, a persistent JVM framework, to offset the cost of
JVM spinup. The downside of this is that it also eliminates the Kernel&rsquo;s ability to accurately
record metrics. As a result, NailGun is used for Clock Time comparisons, while Direct is used for
all kernel metrics.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs" class="relative group">Node.js <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#nodejs" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Node is run simply by running <code>node</code> against the script for the problem in question. It does,
however, have a total of 3 profilers for different versions of Node.js: <code>Node.js 10.15.3</code>,
<code>Node.js 11.15.0</code>, and <code>Node.js 12.3.0</code>.</p>
<h3 id="python-3" class="relative group">Python 3 <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#python-3" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Again, this profiler (<code>Python 3.7.3</code>) usually just consists of running Python3 against the script.
However, it does have an additional profiler, <code>PyPy 3.6-7.1.0</code>, which uses the PyPy implementatio
of Python (as opposed to CPython), to compare metrics across the two Python implementations.</p>
<h3 id="ruby" class="relative group">Ruby <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#ruby" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>This profiler, <code>Ruby 2.6.0</code>, simply uses the <code>ruby</code> interpreter.</p>
<h2 id="clock-time-results" class="relative group">Clock Time Results <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#clock-time-results" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Clock time seems the easiest and most straightforward way to start. It&rsquo;s also the metric that has
arguably the most impact on user experience.</p>
<p>Comparing the direct times is not a very informative graph to look at, because the difference in
computational complexity between problems skews points on the graph too much for comparisons between
profilers to show up on the graph. I control for this by instead doing a relative comparison against
the Golang implementation.</p>

<p>Although this chart offers some pretty clear trends in terms of relative clock time performance
between the five languages, I suspect that is likely due to startup times of each language, given
that the problems where behavior differs significantly are the same problems which take a long time.
Let&rsquo;s look at the average clock time, relative to Golang:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Go 1.12.3 (Compiled)</th>
<th>Groovy 2.5.6/JDK8 (NailGun)</th>

<p>We can see that the performance of just about everything is pretty terrible when compared to Golang.
However, this does seem a bit extreme. Groovy Direct is particularly bad, given the startup cost of
the JVM. Problem 014, however, takes much longer and are much more computationally
intensive, which should give us a better idea of long-running performance:</p>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting data in this row, and I promise we&rsquo;ll get to them later.
It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Golang&rsquo;s implementation of this problem is multithreaded.</p>
<p>We can see that, for the most part, the performance of other runtimes improves dramatically for
longer problems, aside from Groovy. This adds substance to the idea that startup time is the biggest
factor for most of these profilers is startup time. Let&rsquo;s look at the absolute and relative baseline
times for all of these profiles:</p>
<p>(Note: &ldquo;Baseline&rdquo; refers to a file I created for each language with the bare minimum required to
compile and run, and serves to act as a reference point.)</p>

<p>Comparing the relative numbers with those from our overall averages, we can see that they track the
averages very closely. While this tells us a lot about startup time, it means that we have to rely
primarily on 014 for tracking long-term performance, and unfortunately, it tells us that most of our
data points are not measuring much more than startup time. How unfortunate.</p>
<p>But all is not lost, as not only is that valuable information, but 014 gives us a basis for
reasonable comparisons between them. Let&rsquo;s take a look at that table again, and pull some of those
interesting tidbits out:</p>

<p>First of all, I&rsquo;d like to give special kudos to Node.js. Given its reputation and nature, it seems
natural to think of node as a terribly underperforming language. However, it&rsquo;s actually competitive
with Golang here. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t see significant improvements in performance over node
versions.</p>
<p>Second, a huge kudos to PyPy. Where CPython took 21.5 times as long as Golang to complete the
program, PyPy actually <em>outperformed the compiled language</em>, running almost 30x as fast as CPython.
This is quite a feat for an interpreted language. This is only made more impressive when you
consider that the golang implementation was multithreaded, where the Python implementation was not.
We&rsquo;ll look more at PyPy later, in the section <em>PyPy vs CPython</em>.</p>
<p>However, Groovy performed quite poorly here when compared to everything else. This may be poor
programming on my part, but I suspect my solutions the Project Euler problems simply don&rsquo;t play to
Groovy&rsquo;s strengths.</p>
<p>Just for fun, let&rsquo;s compare the real time numbers to the sum of system time and user time for the
Euler014 problem (leaving out NailGun, as times will not be accurate):</p>

<p>Measuring these metrics eliminates the benefits of multithreading (actually, it slightly penalizes
them), and better shows the raw performance of each profiler&rsquo;s methods. We can see that node is
substantially outperforming golang, and that PyPy dramatically outperforms Golang in this specific
metric.</p>
<p>I suspect that Golang&rsquo;s shortcoming here mostly has to do with the way I used slices in the Euler014
problem, relying on append and not pre-provisioning slices to a given capacity. Regardless, PyPy&rsquo;s
performance remains incredible.</p>

It&rsquo;s not a perfect measurement,
but given the size of these problems, it should be appropriate. First, let&rsquo;s look at the baselines
for the profilers (Leaving out NailGun):</p>

<p>The first thing that jumps out is how incredibly expensive Groovy is. Even for a no op, we have to
spin up the JVM, which is incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>Second, we can say the same thing about PyPy. 7 times bigger foorprint than CPython. CPython though,
is very impressive, only taking about 20% more than Golang&rsquo;s empty binary. Ruby and newer versions
of Node are also respectable, with Kudos to Node for showing such dramatic improvement since version
10.x. Perhaps PyPy&rsquo;s frontloading of memory is partially what&rsquo;s responsible for its phenomenal
performance with raw python code.</p>
<p>That aside, let&rsquo;s look at a graph of languages&rsquo; memory footprint over the various problems. Note
that Groovy is left out of this graph, due to its peak of 1.4GB on Euler014 skewing the graph to the
point of unreadability:</p>

<p>This graph has relatively few interesting points. We can see that Ruby performs particularly poorly
on certain problems because it doesn&rsquo;t seem to handle deferred execution quite as well as the other
languages here, in some cases. We can also see that, at least for my implementations of these
problems, overall memory usage is primarily determined by the baseline memory consumption, so
there&rsquo;s a limit to what we can learn outside of edge cases.</p>
<p>However, the comparisons for PyPy and CPython, and for the various versions of Node.js, can show us
a lot:</p>

a static benefit. Of course, this benefit is substantial, but I was hoping to see bigger
improvements for large datasets.</p>

<p>Why am I comparing Groovy to Ruby? Because Ruby was the next worst performing by this metric, and
it was the best I could get when it came to making this graph readable.</p>
<p>The issue, as usual, is problem 014. I suspect that the bulk of the problem goes to using such an
old version of the Java Development Kit, but even with JDK 11, performance is still terrible
compared to all other implementations. Unfortunately, I feel like deferred execution has been
treated like a second-class citizen in the JDK, even with Java streams, lagging behind the other
languages in functional programming functionality and performance.</p>

<p>Well, we certainly saw some interesting results for comparisons of CPython and PyPy. CPython&rsquo;s
miniscule memory footprint is certainly a strong asset, but the memory cost of PyPy would likely
more than offset the additional memory usage for most use cases where it&rsquo;s viable. Where we see the
greatest benefits in particular, is in CPU Time for large degrees of complexity.</p>
<p>So why is this? Well, let&rsquo;s start with what PyPy is, according to <a href="https://pypy.org/features.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pypy.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PyPy is a replacement for CPython. It is built using the RPython language that was co-developed with it&hellip;
with a Just-in-Time compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there it is - JiT compilation is likely the key to its performance for larger programs. This
gives it particularly good performance when running a lot of Pure Python code. One of the tricks to
this is that PyPy actually has a huge amount of overhead when loading C++ extensions, which are
the typical answer to the problem of making CPython reasonably performant for number crunching.</p>
<p>My parameters for developing these solutions - particularly limiting third-party libraries, means
that PyPy has almost a perfect use case in this instance. However, the performance of PyPy in this
case is still illustrative of its utility - for code that can be converted to pure python, it is
incredibly performant.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions" class="relative group">Conclusions <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#conclusions" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The most obvious conclusion that can be drawn is that, for most cases we&rsquo;ve been looking at, Golang
is a phenomenal tool. The miniscule memory footprint and phenomenal all-around performance is
wonderful to work with - it&rsquo;s as popular as it is for a reason. And there&rsquo;s a reason my profiler is
written in it. The benefits of &ldquo;truly&rdquo; compiled languages, like Golang and Swift, are substantial,
especially these days when Software is written with so much bloat. The parallelism techniques that
are available in Groovy are also very welcome.</p>
<p>All that said, interpreted languages, particularly Node.js, perform extremely well and are closing
the gap in terms of performance. I often here Node and Electron decryed as slow technologies, but
looking at the real performance data I have in front to me, it seems like perhaps poor coding is a
more likely culprit than the underlying technology. I use the editor Visual Studio Code, which is
built on Node.js, and it runs better than many of the IDEs I&rsquo;ve used written on supposedly more
performant technologies. That said, Node does seem to be relatively memory-hungry.</p>
<p>While Groovy deals poorly with particularly large data sets and has huge startup time, it does seem
to be relatively fast. That said, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d favor it too heavily against jRuby or
Jython, or even Java. It seems to me like Groovy has a bit of an identity crisis, not knowing for
sure what it wants to be or accomplish, and so it doesn&rsquo;t accomplish a whole lot aside from being a
scripting language that runs on the JVM.</p>
<p>Ruby&rsquo;s conventions are powerful, but its performance is anything but. Coming in last (other than
Groovy), it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be particularly good at anything. That said, its elegance does make it
well-suited to IO-heavy operations, abstractions, and relatively simple code problems. As an
example, it is very well-suited to simple scripts or applications like Homebrew, where the
simplicity of the conventions can be used to great effect.</p>
<p>Finally, Python. Python&rsquo;s tiny footprint and strong support for deferred execution mean it does far
better when it comes to memory usage than most other languages in its class, and the versatility of
being a scripting language is definitely handy. That said, the computational performance for CPython
is disappointing, though not surprising, given that it relies so heavily upon C++ Extensions to make
Python code performant. PyPy&rsquo;s performance on the other hand, takes all the advantages of
Pure Python and tacks on a massive benefit to performance - for those looking to write applications
in Python, PyPy is definitely worth considering as a platform for the performance benefits alone.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow" class="relative group">Tomorrow <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#tomorrow" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>So what&rsquo;s next? Well, although this dataset was interesting, it&rsquo;s lacking in a lot of ways. The
relative simplicity of the first 20 Project Euler problems means that we don&rsquo;t get to see much
beyond the baseline startup costs, to the point that most of this blog post is focused around a
single problem. Likewise, the profiling system lacks maturity, and I intend to iterate upon it as
well.</p>
<p>Toward that end, I intend to continue this project going forward, and to develop more solutions
across these languages to better observe that behavior. That said, it seems likely at this point
that I may discontinue Groovy. It seems to perform poorly for large problems, and I may need to move
away from it to keep the overall profiling system clean. While I learned a lot about the JDK, I just
don&rsquo;t think these problems are well suited to Groovy in particular, and perhaps the JDK in general.
I&rsquo;ll do some research to see if perhaps Clojure or Kotlin would fill those shoes better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are other profilers I&rsquo;d like to create, namely disabling the garbage collector on
Golang, and creating a profiler for Python that utilized Python optimization. I may also try adding
C# or F#, to get a language built on the .NET framework, and perhaps try again with Swift, though
compilation of small, standalone binaries can get complicated.</p>
<p>All in all, a very promising start to this project, with plenty left to do.</p>
