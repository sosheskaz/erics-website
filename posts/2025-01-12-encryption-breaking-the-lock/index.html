        Encryption has become ubiquitous in our everyday life, to the point that it fades into the
background. This page is served over an encrypted connection, as are most web pages. Our phones are
generally encrypted, many laptops are encrypted, and virtually all communications that travel over
the internet are encrypted in transit. To explain the utility of the technology of encryption, we
often use the metaphor of &ldquo;lock and key&rdquo;. This metaphor is not wrong, but it is limited in a
way that I think would benefit from broader understanding. This becomes particularly important when
we start talking about public policy, and the relationship between encryption and governments.

        <p>Encryption has become ubiquitous in our everyday life, to the point that it fades into the
background. This page is served over an encrypted connection, as are most web pages. Our phones are
generally encrypted, many laptops are encrypted, and virtually all communications that travel over
the internet are encrypted in transit. To explain the utility of the technology of encryption, we
often use the metaphor of &ldquo;lock and key&rdquo;. This metaphor is not <em>wrong</em>, but it is limited in a
way that I think would benefit from broader understanding. This becomes particularly important when
we start talking about public policy, and the relationship between encryption and governments.</p>
<p>After the explainers, I will opine for a bit on the current and upcoming news, as the technology and
the world around it have both changed a lot in the past few years.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lock-and-key" class="relative group">Lock and Key <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#lock-and-key" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The encryption/lock metaphor is fairly straightforward. A lock is a device that restricts access to
&ldquo;something&rdquo;. The lock is activated with a key, making that &ldquo;something&rdquo; accessible. Thus, we ensure
that only authorized people may access that &ldquo;something&rdquo;, by only sharing the key with authorized
people. Encryption is similar, but for data: It has a key, only shared with parties who should have
access to the data. Without the key, the data is unreadable. However, by processing the data with
that key, we can render it into a readable format.</p>
<p>This metaphor glosses over some details, but broadly speaking, it gives a fair understanding of what
encryption does and how it works. However, there are a few lies here—some about encryption, and some
about actual, physical locks.</p>
<h2 id="the-technology-of-physical-locks" class="relative group">The Technology of Physical Locks <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-technology-of-physical-locks" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>When we imagine a lock, we imagine a physical device, like a padlock, a deadbolt, or a safe. These
devices use mechanical or electro-mechanical components in order to maintain and transition between
two possible states: &ldquo;locked&rdquo; and &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo;. The device is built to transition state easily when
presented with its matching key, but to resist transitioning state, especially from &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; to
&ldquo;locked&rdquo;, without that key. A mechanical component of the lock usually comes out of it, in order to
create this physical effect, which allows us to link the system of the &ldquo;lock&rdquo; with other systems,
like a door. On a deadbolt lock, this s the bolt. On a padlock, this is the shank. This part is also
generally pretty sturdy, to avoid being circumvented by physical means.</p>
<p>However, locks are not <em>absolute</em>. They can be tricked, bypassed, broken, or used improperly. In one
sense, this is an inherent limitation of the technology. In another sense, this is absolutely vital
to the function of our society.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that locks are not purely a mechanical technology; they are also a
social technology. A padlock is pretty easy to defeat, a mere $25 for some bolt. Despite this fact, people generally expect that when
leaving their things in a public locker, their things will still be present upon return. This is
because if a random person walks into a locker area with a pair of bolt cutters, a fuss will be raised, the
person will likely be threatened, and police will likely show up. Even if the perpetrator escapes, they
will likely show up on camera footage. These things are not inherent, nor are they properties of the
mechanical device. Rather, they are properties of the associated social technology.</p>
<p>This is something that is broadly understood within the physical security industry. The purpose of a
lock is not so much to &ldquo;deny&rdquo; unauthorized access, as it is to &ldquo;delay&rdquo; unauthorized access. This is
also evident in the <a href="https://inkassafes.com/ul-certifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">certification of safes</a>; their
security ratings are not based on whether it can be broken into with certain tools, but
<em>how long it takes</em> for a person of sufficient skill to break in with a specific set of tools. The
greater time and difficulty makes the attacker more conspicuous, more likely to be seen, heard, or
caught on camera.</p>
<p>This is because the goal of a lock is not to prohibit access completely, but to impede
or dissuade an attack, either ensuring that the attacker gets caught, or preventing the attack
completely with the threat of catching the attacker.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, locks are an important construct from a legal standpoint. A part of the social
technology of a lock is that, when a person encounters a lock, they may infer &ldquo;this is private
property that the owner wishes to exclude me from&rdquo;, similar to a sign. Where opening a closed door
may be trespassing, picking or circumventing a lock to open that door will usually upgrade the
severity of that crime to &ldquo;breaking and entering&rdquo;, and may be used in assessing the criminal&rsquo;s
intent. &ldquo;I was looking for the bathroom&rdquo; becomes a less plausible excuse, if you&rsquo;ve just finished
drilling through a deadbolt.</p>
<p>In part, this is because a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; lock is not possible. In part, this is because an perfect lock
is not desirable. A perfect lock would never open without the key, even if the true owner of that
lock was present. It would not open for a firefighter, or for a warranted search. It would become

<p><em>On the Internet, nobody knows you&rsquo;re a dog.</em></p>
<p>The social technologies that locks rely on generally do not translate particularly well to computer
systems.</p>
<p>First, some background on what encryption is and how it works: Someone generates a &ldquo;key&rdquo;. That key is a
small chunk of random data, about 32 bytes. There is an algorithm, which can pass some <em>other</em> data
through, using the key like a filter. This is &ldquo;encryption&rdquo;. The result appears to be a bunch of
random nonsense to anyone looking at it—completely invalid, random data. That data can be passed
back through the algorithm, filtered back through the key, running in reverse, and restored back to
the original data. This is &ldquo;decryption&rdquo;. This process, of rendering data into nonsense, and back
into usable data, by using the key to form the filter, is the core of what encryption is.</p>
<p>Described above is &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo; encryption. There is a second kind of encryption,
&ldquo;asymmetric encryption&rdquo;, which uses different maths and has somewhat different goals. Asymmetric
encryption can obfuscate data similar to symmetric encryption, but it can be used for communication
between two parties which <em>do not have the same key</em>, allowing messages to be sent safely without
pre-sharing a key.</p>
<p>The greatest problem is a core characteristic of computers: they are excellent at <strong>copying data
quickly and perfectly</strong>. When a message is sent over the internet, like when opening a web page, the
local computer first forms the data it wants to send in-memory, then sends that data over the
network. The data then reaches a router or repeater, which then reads the data, copies it, and sends
the copy wherever it needs to go. This happens repeatedly as the data transits the internet, likely
over a dozen times, before reaching its destination. For computers, copying information is so easy,
we don&rsquo;t bother moving it, and instead just copy, copy, copy. There is no distinction between the
original data and a copy of it, because the copy is perfect. The process of copying computer data
also does not inherently leave any trace; some computer systems may record some access activity, but
these systems may themselves be compromised, and because data is copied extremely often, it can be
difficult to differentiate between access by a human, and access which was functionally necessary.</p>
<p>Gaining unauthorized access to computer data is meaningfully different than getting access to a
physical location, because access to data generally confers the ability to make a copy of that data.
Imagine sending someone a text; you cannot prevent them from taking a screenshot, nor can you detect
that they took a screenshot. We may suggest a solution of making the phone notify the other person
in the conversation about the screenshot, but this could be circumvented by taking a picture of the
phone, and would create many new problems.</p>
<p>Since copying data is necessary to the basic function the computers, it is not a particularly
conspicuous activity. And once data is copied, it can be worked on later. Where bypassing a lock may
require time working on the lock, tools, or both, making the attacker very conspicuous, these are
not requirements for bypassing encryption. When encrypted data transits a network, anywhere it
transits through may secretly take a copy, and take their time attempting to break in, and it is
completely invisible and anonymous. There is little to no risk of someone noticing, and even if they
notice, they probably can&rsquo;t tie it to the attacker.</p>
<p>At the same time, anonymity on the internet is generally available. VPNs and Onion Routers can make
it quite difficult to trace an attack back to the person who made it, which in turn makes the
consequences for attempting to break in quite low.</p>
<p>The permissible gaps of locks enable also introduce problems. A physical lock may be opened by force
in response to a legal warrant, but this capability does not exist for computers; it cannot exist.
This is because, from an encryption algorithm&rsquo;s perspective, there is <em>no meaningful difference</em>
between a government attempting to gain unauthorized access, and a criminal enterprise attempting to
gain, unauthorized access; their actions are fundamentally identical in the context of the system.</p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em></p>
<p>This all makes encryption much more subject to scrutiny than physical locks. Because it is easy to
simply &ldquo;make a copy&rdquo; of the data you want to attack, and to do it privately, the mechanism
of encryption itself must be practically perfect. While this is an undesirable characteristic for a
physical lock, the <em>sheer hostility</em> of cyberspace means that anything short of &ldquo;impenetrable&rdquo; will
be broken into by bad actors. This is why encryption is, and must remain, impenetrable.</p>
<h2 id="policy-and-news" class="relative group">Policy and News <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#policy-and-news" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The article to this point should explain, in broad strokes, why a &ldquo;perfect lock&rdquo; does not, and
cannot, exist in the physical world, but is a <em>necessity</em> for information security. Hopefully, the
examination of the social technology behind locks, and the extended application of that metaphor,
lead to some severe issues.</p>
<h3 id="end-to-end-encryption" class="relative group">End-To-End Encryption <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#end-to-end-encryption" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>A technology has been rising, called &ldquo;end-to-end () encryption&rdquo;, or its counterpart, &ldquo;zero-knowledge
encryption&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you open MySpace, and send a message to your friend Tom. When you open MySpace in
your browser, the connection is encrypted. This means that your message is sent to MySpace
privately, and no one in between you and MySpace can snoop on its contents. MySpace then sends the
message to Tom, also using encryption. This means that your message to Tom is not entirely private;
the carrier of the message, MySpace, also gets to see it.</p>
<p>This is the default way that the internet, and communications on it, work. For some communications,
it is entirely appropriate, but for some communications, this is not a sufficient level of privacy.
End-to-end encryption solves this problem, by having the local computers encrypt it. This means that
the provider (MySpace) is never able to see the contents of the message sent. MySpace can still see
that <strong>a</strong> message was sent, and probably its approximate size and frequency, but not the <strong>contents</strong>.</p>
<p>Zero-Knowledge Encryption is a somewhat similar concept, but not for communication. When uploading
files to Google Drive, Google can see all of the contents of those files. Zero-knowledge encryption
platforms, on the other hand, ensure that the data is encrypted before it is uploaded to their
servers, so that they do not have access to their contents.</p>
<p>The gold standard for end-to-end encrypted communications is <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Signal</a>. They
have a high-quality protocol, using strong algorithms, are early adopters to quantum-resistant
cryptography, and their technology is open-source for free inspection by security researchers and
consumer advocates.</p>
<p>Some other mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>WhatsApp is E2E encrypted using the Signal protocol, but their implementation is closed-source and
is owned by Meta, which I do not consider to be trustworthy stewards of data.</li>
<li>iMessage is E2E encrypted, but the details are not readily available.</li>
<li>Text messages (SMS) are never E2E encrypted.</li>
<li>Email is never E2E encrypted, and essentially cannot be.</li>
<li>High-quality encryption can be added to otherwise-unencrypted communications using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PGP</a>, but this is generally complicated and annoying.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-government" class="relative group">The Government <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-government" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The United States government, as well as many other governments, have expressed an interest in being
able to decrypt their subjects&rsquo; encrypted communications, or, failing that, to eliminate civilian
encrypted communications entirely. This is an extraordinarily bad idea.</p>
<p>An old approach to this is called &ldquo;Key Escrow&rdquo;. The basic idea of this is that the government has a
secret key, which is able to decrypt all encrypted materials. This generally requires an algorithm
that supports such a key, which would mean that other forms of encryption would need to be
prohibited. This was attempted in the 90s, and
<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">failed spectacularly</a>,
with the government&rsquo;s encryption demonstrated to be insecure, even before the real challenges showed
themselves. If the key ever leaked, because someone with access decided to spy on their ex, or to
sell the key on the black market, or because they were an asset of an adversarial nation, just once,
then that key would now be out in the wild—every bit of data using that encryption mechanism would
become possible to decrypt by anyone who had a copy of the data.</p>
<p>Historically, the FBI has occasionally highlighted a criminal as &ldquo;this is why we need to ban
encryption&rdquo;, to play to emotional manipulation. They like to draw metaphors to &ldquo;warrants&rdquo;, and to
claim that the private sector is refusing to cooperate, even when they are doing everything that
they can to help.</p>
<p>Various legislative attempts have been made to ban encryption over the years, or, failing that, use
liability to create an <em>effective</em> ban. The way this generally works is that the legislature sets
out the requirement that any company which is incapable of turning over user content to the
government on request becomes liable for their users&rsquo; activity. In effect, this makes it legally
untenable to &ldquo;do what end-to-end encryption does&rdquo;, without using the words &ldquo;ban encryption&rdquo;.
When critics pointed out that this would have an extreme chilling effect on the offering of
encrypted services, to the point of effectively banning end-to-end encryption, the legislators slyly
mentioned that &ldquo;the bill does not mention encryption&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is worth recalling the bit about computers, how &ldquo;copying data&rdquo; is a pretty easy thing to do. A
powerful key would expand the government&rsquo;s surveillance abilities dramatically, and if the
government (or a rogue government employee who couldn&rsquo;t get over their ex) were to surveil citizens
without a warrant, it would be virtually impossible to prove that they had done so, and it would
almost certainly happen. I am not inclined to trust that the government will be respectful of its
citizens&rsquo; privacy
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/07/snowden-nsa-employees-routinely-pass-around-intercepted-nude-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">based on their previous behavior</a>.
Remember, also, that because copying is generally covert, it would be virtually impossible to prove
or disprove that this kind of thing was going on.</p>
<p>Recently, however, the government has changed tact somewhat.</p>
<h3 id="the-telecom-hack-and-cisa" class="relative group">The Telecom Hack and CISA <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-telecom-hack-and-cisa" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The Unites States telecommunications industry has recently experienced one of
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/suspected-china-linked-hack-us-telecoms-worst-nations-history-senator-says-2024-11-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the largest hacks of all time</a>,
believed to be perpetrated by hackers backed by the Chinese government,
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/10/china-possibly-hacking-us-lawful-access-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">using a back door that the US installed to be able to wiretap its citizens</a>.
This should demonstrate a secondary issue with government interference. As mentioned before, there
is no meaningful distinction in a computer system between &ldquo;lawful unauthorized access&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unlawful unauthorized access&rdquo;. Any rails that are set up for the government, can be used by other
actors.</p>
<p>In 2018, a new government agency was formed, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA). This agency&rsquo;s goal is to work to make sure that the United States&rsquo; digital infrastructure
is reasonably secure against foreign intrusion, including private infrastructure. More recently,
they have been trying to amp up encryption within the US private sector, because the country is
under-prepared for the impact of cyber warfare, as the United States foreign policy apparatus is
pivoting to deal with &ldquo;near-peer&rdquo; adversaries.</p>
<p>As this foreign policy pivot kicks into gear, I would expect the calls to remove encryption to get
a bit quieter, as any compromise to encryption to facilitate domestic surveillance would also
weaken the country&rsquo;s national defense posture. We may also get contradictory views from the domestic
law enforcement apparatus and the foreign policy apparatus, which may have disaligned objectives on
this matter.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-computing" class="relative group">Quantum Computing <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#quantum-computing" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Quantum Computing has been advancing in recent years.</p>
<p>This is important because quantum computing makes an algorithm,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shor&rsquo;s algorithm</a> could be used to break current
asymmetric encryption schemes. If this were to occur today, the owner of that computer could wreak
unbelievable havoc. It would become possible to break into a large number of computer systems that
are impenetrable today, as well as to move laterally within compromised systems, and to impersonate
all sorts of people and governments. It would be&hellip; quite bad.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is only known to affect <em>asymmetric encryption</em>, which is used in
communications; symmetric encryption, like the kind used to password-protect computers and disks, is
not under threat.</p>
<p>More worrying, is &ldquo;capture now, decrypt later&rdquo;. This idea is that a powerful institution with deep
pockets, like a government, would collect massive amounts of encrypted communications, waiting for
a quantum computer capable of cracking them, to become available. Once available, this institution
could begin the work of decrypting all of those captured communications. It is generally believed
that most world powers are probably engaging in this to some degree, although &ldquo;to what degree&rdquo; is
not public knowledge, and this is largely speculation. That said, from a government&rsquo;s perspective,
there is little reason not to do this; storage is cheap, and &ldquo;what the American public doesn&rsquo;t know,
is what makes them the American public&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first bit of good news here is that &ldquo;quantum-resistant&rdquo; encryption algorithms already exist, and
are being implemented in platforms like <a href="https://essay.utwente.nl/77239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Signal</a> and
<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iMessage</a>, layered with &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; encryption to
hedge against the risk of problems in these new algorithms, while still realizing quantum-resistant
benefits.</p>
<p>The second bit of good news is that, while Quantum computers are advancing, they are far from being
able to break these encryption paradigms. With new optimizations, it is understood that RSA 2048,
the weakest and most common asymmetric encryption algorithm, could be cracked by a quantum computer
a few thousand high-quality qubits. With the breakthroughs recently, we are able to construct
quantum computers with just over 1,000 low-quality qubits. To approximate the equivalence, 1
high-quality qubit is proably worth about ~12 low-quality qubits, because that is the number of
qubits necessary to perform error correction effectively enough to provide one logical qubit.
Quantum computers currently have exceedingly high error rates, which make them difficult to use for
a precision task like cracking encryption. Many more years of steady progress, and a few more
breakthroughs, will be necessary before this is a true threat. The napkin math these days is that a
quantum computer of the necessary power and quality is probably at least 20 years away.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-currency-and-crypto-assets" class="relative group">Crypto Currency and Crypto Assets <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#crypto-currency-and-crypto-assets" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>In 2025, the topic of encryption merits a discussion of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Recall earlier the discussion of how locks have both &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; and &ldquo;social&rdquo; components to their
technology. Financial systems act similarly. We have many mathematical technologies, and
computerized applications of those technologies, which make up our financial systems. These
technologies are also applied and administered by human beings. A company may use a credit score to
decide whether you qualify for a loan, but the decision about the score required to qualify will be
informed, if not by a human, then by an algorithm written by a human, to achieve certain outcomes of
risk, profit, and liquidity for the financial institution.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is an attempt to create a distributed computer system, controlled by no one entity,
which can perform the full function of a transactional financial system, without the need for
intermediaries or arbitrariness. A system defined not by who controls it, because no one controls
it, but by firm rules, as unmovable as mathematics itself. A system which is perfectly fair,
perfectly equal, and perfectly accessible. The principles of cryptocurrency are in encryption, which
makes it relevant, and makes it inherit many of the characteristics discussed earlier.</p>
<p>An important departure, however, is cryptocurrency&rsquo;s defining characteristic: strict uniqueness.
While it may be possible to &ldquo;view&rdquo; a bitcoin, or even to &ldquo;copy&rdquo; it, but doing so would not
<em>transfer</em> the bitcoin. When that bitcoin is transferred, it is not copied, but <em>moved</em>. Further,
this is done with <em>no central authority</em> keeping track of who has the currency. This is an
incredible technological feat, to use cryptography to overcome what have historically been
fundamental limitations of computer systems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, cryptocurrency&rsquo;s primary value proposition is illicit payments, although
it has assembled an impressive secondary ecosystem of grifters, scammers, and gurus.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrency, like the U.S. dollar, is &ldquo;Fiat money&rdquo;. It does not have any backing source of
inherent value. Instead, its value is based in whatever it can be redeemed for. For example, most
stores near me will accept U.S. dollars, while relatively few will accept Bitcoin. Bitcoin has many
problems, but one of them is that as a medium of exchange, it is both expensive and slow. On a good
day, the average Bitcoin transaction is about $50, and takes over an hour to complete. The
transactions are absolute, and impossible to reverse due to fraud or other reasons. Further, the
underlying currency has an extremely unstable value, and may change significantly between the start
and and of the transaction. Visa may have their issues, but they are also the better option.</p>
<p>For paying for lunch, these limitations are unaccessible. However, for illicit payments, these
trade-offs are often worthwhile. Cryptocurrency makes it possible to anonymously transfer large sums
of money over long distances in a way that cannot directly be associated with the identity of either
participant. These characteristics are highly desirable for dealing drugs, evading taxes,
extortion, and other illegal activities.</p>
<p>This first rose to prominence in the rise of
<a href="https://www.avast.com/c-silk-road-dark-web-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Silk Road</a>, where it enabled buying and
selling of illicit goods and services over long distances. This could not have had the success that
it did without cryptocurrency, and at the time, was the main selling point of bitcoin. Ultimately,
they failed not because of insolvency, but because of a government raid.</p>
<p>These days, the Silk Road is no more, but Crypto is still a great tool for illicit payments. Most
prominent and problematic is Ransomware, software which encrypts computers, rendering them unusable,
and suggests that they will be decrypted should sufficient payment be sent in cryptocurrency. This
is currently an endemic problem for businesses and municipalities. Cryptocurrency is what makes this
criminal enterprise viable.</p>
<p>The other major use of cryptocurrency was &ldquo;Non-Fungible Tokens&rdquo;, or NFTs; they have largely fallen
out of fashion. These take advantage of the &ldquo;strict uniqueness&rdquo; characteristics that Crypto offers,
and to imbue them into small tokens, representative of&hellip; something, usually implied (but not
explicitly stated) to be something similar to &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;. It is possible to mathematically prove to
whose wallet that token belongs, but not much else. They have no legal bearing, and any practical
use would require software services to support <em>that specific kind</em> of NFT, which has not been
meaningfully implemented anywhere except Twitter
(<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/x-removes-support-for-nft-profile-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">and even that is no more</a>).
It seems people have largely lost interest.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is intriguing, but the greatest importance that I can sense from it is
downstream of cryptocurrencies themselves. They led to the development of GPU devices that is
now facilitating the AI boom we are currently seeing, which has come in to build out practical
applications for the historically powerful compute devices that were created to sate the demand of
crypto miners. Other technologies, like ledger databases, are also becoming mainstream, exploiting
the benefits and cryptographic guarantees of blockchain technology, while mitigating the drawbacks
by being less distributed and operating within trusted environments. The existence of blockchain
technology, while mixed in practice, has also measurably moved the technology industry forward by
inventing, demonstrating, and popularizing the capabilities inherent to blockchain technology.</p>
