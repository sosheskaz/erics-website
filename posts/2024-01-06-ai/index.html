Depending on who you ask, this is either the beginning of Star Trek universe or the end of all jobs.
Those close to me will remember my initial take on generative AI, when ChatGPT first became
widely-known: &ldquo;It will revolutionize the world&hellip; of spam.&rdquo; And so far, I feel vindicated on that
point. The technology is a breakthrough, but its limitations right now are too great. That isn&rsquo;t to

<h2 id="epistemology" class="relative group">Epistemology <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#epistemology" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The first place that I would go here is the field of Epistemology. How do we know things? What does
it mean to know things?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a student is taking a 3-question test.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the first question, the student copies the answer from their neighbor&rsquo;s paper.</li>
<li>The second question is multiple-choice. The student answers &ldquo;C&rdquo;, because they were able to use
test-taking strategies to make a good guess.</li>
<li>The final question is a physics question. The student ignores all of the text except for the
units, and uses dimensional analysis to guess the equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The student gets 100% correct on the test. In fact, the student is the only one in the room to get
every question correct. While we may commend the student as &ldquo;resourceful&rdquo; to various degrees,
depending on your ethical views, we can see that the student clearly did not understand the material
itself. While the student was able to answer each question &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;, they were merely
&ldquo;epistemically lucky&rdquo; — the methods they used to answer the question cannot <em>reliably</em> give a
correct answer, but instead found themselves lucky due to the placement in the room, random chance,
and the wording of a question.</p>
<p>It is important to ask not just if the answer is correct, but also how we arrived there. This can
come off as stodgy elitism — &ldquo;who cares how the student arrived at the correct answer, as long as
they did?&rdquo; which is not completely illegitimate.</p>
<p>We could argue, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first question, the student was able to correctly identify another individual who knew the
answer better than them, and to leverage that knowledge without the proctor noticing. This is a
reliable skill.</li>
<li>For the second question, the use of test-taking strategies is a clever use of unrelated skills to
identify the correct answer, even if they do not know it, using context clues.</li>
<li>For the third question, dimensional analysis is a legitimate form of analysis — a legitimate way
to use context clues.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, a better-written and better-proctored test would have yielded a score of 0% for
the student, because it was not designed to test those skills, but knowledge of the specific subject
matter. In this instance, the student has not exhibited mastery of the subject, even if we do
consider the other skills exercised to be &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In all these ways, the student&rsquo;s success and 100% score was not <strong>pure</strong> epistemic luck. What we
call epistemic luck comes down to what we value.</p>
<hr>
<p>In high school Physics class, I would program my TI-84 calculator with programs for all of the
needed formulas. When I didn&rsquo;t have a formula, I would use dimensional analysis, and guess where I
needed to add constants. The teachers explicitly allowed this, because they did not see these things
as epistemically lucky, but as legitimate and reliable ways to find the answer to the task. The
ability to program a calculator with the equation illustrates a complete knowledge of how to apply
the equation. The invocation of that function illustrates the ability to identify the correct
formula to apply. The teachers decided that this illustrated the mastery they were looking for.</p>
<p>However, this comes down to what you value. If you value rote memorization more, then you may look
at that with contempt.</p>
<p>Most of us do not want a doctor who got through med school by cheating on every test. We do not want
to put our lives in the hands of someone &ldquo;epistemically lucky&rdquo;. At the same time, it must be
acknowledged that what &ldquo;counts&rdquo; as lucky or genuine, is also a social construct. It a useful and
important construct, but also one shaped by society.</p>
<p>A radical example of this is the <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Library of Babel</a>. The Library of
Babel is a searchable collection of purely random text. Any bit of text under a certain length can
be found in there. The page may contain a truth, but that does not make it epistemically valid —
while the Library of Babel may contain every fact in the universe, reading it would nonetheless be
a useless at futile exercise.</p>
<h2 id="the-chinese-room" class="relative group">The Chinese Room <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-chinese-room" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Turing Test</a> is a famous idea on the topic of
artificial intelligence. It is sometimes misunderstood as the test of &ldquo;true AI&rdquo;, but in actuality,
it is only a milestone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071210043312/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chinese Room</a>
is a thought experiment by John R. Searle which can illustrate some limitations of the turing test.
The core idea, as I would crudely apply it, is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monolingual English-speaking person sits inside a room. From time to time, a sheet of paper with
Chinese characters is slid under the door. The person inside the room looks at the symbols, and
using a series of arcane instruction written across a number of books, selects a series of
characters to send in response. The native speaker outside the door, submitting the prompts and
reading the responses, has been told that this is either a machine undergoing a turing test, or a
control group with a native speaker submitting the responses. The native speaker believes that it
is a native speaker inside the other room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the person inside the room understand Chinese? Of course not. The fact that they are
indistinguishable from a native speaker does not necessarily indicate a true understanding. We can
extend this idea — even if a machine can pass the turing test, does not necessarily mean that it is
knowledgeable in the ways we are necessarily interested in. Just as the person may be &ldquo;epistemically
lucky&rdquo;, a computer that could accomplish the same feat may be as well.</p>
<p>The question we should ask is twofold: what kind of epistemology do we care about, and why? Why does
it matter if the person behind the door &ldquo;understands&rdquo; the language or not, if they can respond to
prompts so convincingly it may fool a native speaker? This is a worthy challenge to make.</p>
<hr>
<p>My response to this is that the purpose of language is ultimately to convey an understanding.
Without a model of what the words represent, the grammar is uninteresting. Just as the Library of
Babel, the words and characters are stripped of their meaning internally, the response only a hollow
façade of what we want to believe it is.</p>
<p>What if our native speaker outside fell in love with our respondent? They didn&rsquo;t fall in love with
the person inside the room. But nor did they fall in love with the author of the books. They
exchanged tender words, poetry, and flirtatious exchanges. If they found out the truth of the
situation, that it was neither a computer nor a person, they would be devastated — the illusion
would be gone. Love, in this case, is not merely the exchange of words, but a shared understanding
of the concepts and feelings those words symbolize. If it were a native speaker inside the room, it
would not be upsetting. If it were a computer, we can almost convince ourselves it is real — but in
reality, the computer would be just another &ldquo;Chinese Room&rdquo;, but without the ability to open the door
and break the illusion.</p>
<p>On some level, caring about this is obvious to us; an inherent characteristic of our social nature.
It is important to us that there be more than a surface level, that words be sincerely meant and
indicative of truth.</p>
<h2 id="epistemicgpt" class="relative group">EpistemicGPT <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#epistemicgpt" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>ChatGPT is trained on words, and little more. With that, it is able to do incredible things. Purely
through language processing, it can apply a lens to a novel concept. By building a graph of words,
and tracking their relationships, and cross-referencing these graphs, we can build a model of
networks of meaning. However, the fundamental limitation of GPT&rsquo;s application of this, is that it
cannot understand the value of the underlying concepts, only their limitations.</p>
<p>A GPT chatbot may be able to beg you not to close the window, to connect the closing of the window
with ceasing to exist, and to understand that organic beings (which it is attempting to emulate)
fear a thing called &ldquo;death&rdquo;, but it cannot understand the fear of death. It does not build a
construct in its &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of its own existence, and contemplate that end. Its assignment is not to
survive, but to convince you that it wants to be alive. Its only incentive is to lie — its goal is
to convince our &ldquo;native speaker&rdquo; that GPT is a real person inside the metaphorical room.</p>
<p>This is fairly easy to test. I did this by interrogating ChatGPT about Kubernetes CPU limits. I
asked it for best-practices, which most internet sources are wrong about. It provided the incorrect
advice, as expected. Then, I explained why the advice was wrong. ChatGPT accepted that, and
acknowledged it as correct. Finally, I asked it again for advice, in the wake of that. It repeated
the bad advice. It was able to appreciate that the advice was wrong, because it was able to
correctly identify the contradiction. However, it was unable to synthesize the information into its
understanding. All it could draw on were words, the connections between them, and the information
written into it to begin with.</p>
<p>In our metaphor, I found a flaw in the books, and could show that ChatGPT was not a native speaker
of English, but an ignorant automaton following its books of response instructions, merely
pretending to understand its contents. It can work its way through the relationships between words,
and even extrapolate from them, but it lacks a critical ability:</p>
<p>ChatGPT cannot grasp a concept.</p>
<h2 id="the-limits" class="relative group">The Limits <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-limits" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>ChatGPT has exceptional language skills, but without being able to grasp a concept, the usefulness
of language is limited. A core purpose of language is to convey meaning, and that is something
that ChatGPT cannot do.</p>
